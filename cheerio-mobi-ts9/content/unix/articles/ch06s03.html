its author can successfully understand and modify it. Maintainability
demands more than code that works; it demands code that follows
the Rule of Clarity and communicates successfully to human beings
as well as the computer.</p><p>Unix programmers have a lot of implicit knowledge available to
them about what makes for maintainable code, because Unix hosts source
code that goes back decades.  For reasons we'll discuss in <a href="portabilitychapter.html" title="Chapter�17.�Portability">Chapter�17</a>, Unix programmers learn a tendency to
scrap and rebuild rather than patching grubby code (see Rob Pike's
meditation on this subject in <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter�1.�Philosophy">Chapter�1</a>).  Thus, any sources that have survived
more than a decade of evolutionary pressure have been selected for
maintainability. These old, successful, well-established projects with
maintainable code are the community's models for practice.</p><p>A question Unix programmers — and especially Unix
programmers in the open-source world — learn to ask about tools
they are evaluating for use is: “Is this code live, dormant, or
dead?”  Live code has an active developer community attached
to it.  Dormant code has often become dormant because the pain of
maintaining it exceeded its utility to its originators.  Dead code has
been dormant for so long that it would be easier to reimplement an
equivalent from scratch.  If you want your code to live, investing
effort to make it maintainable (and therefore attractive to future
maintainers) will be one of the most effective ways you can spend your
time.</p><p>Code that is designed to be both transparent and
discoverable<a id="id2915277" class="indexterm">
has gone a long way toward being maintainable.  But there are other
practices we can observe in the model projects in this chapter that
are worth emulating.</a></p><p>One very important practice is an application of the Rule of
Clarity: choosing simple algorithms.  In <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter�1.�Philosophy">Chapter�1</a> we quoted Ken Thompson: “When in
doubt, use brute force”.  Thompson<a id="id2915308" class="indexterm"> understood the full cost of complicated
algorithms — not just that they're more bug-prone when initially
implemented, but that they're harder for maintainers down the line to
understand.</a></p><p>Another important practice is the inclusion of hacker's guides.
It has always been highly approved behavior for source code
distributions to include guide documents informally describing the key
data structures and algorithms in the code. In fact, Unix programmers
have often been better about producing hacker's guides than they are
about writing end-user documentation.</p><p>The open-source community has seized on and elaborated this
custom.  Besides being advice to future maintainers, hacker's guides
for open-source projects are also designed to make it easy for casual
contributors to add features or fix bugs.  The Design Notes file
shipped with
<i>fetchmail</i><a id="id2915346" class="indexterm">
is representative.  The Linux<a id="id2915354" class="indexterm"> kernel sources include literally dozens
of these.</a></a></p><p>In <a href="opensourcechapter.html" title="Chapter�19.�Open Source">Chapter�19</a> we'll
describe conventions that Unix developers have evolved for making
source code distributions easy to examine and easy to build running
code from. These practices, too, promote maintainability.</p></div>
