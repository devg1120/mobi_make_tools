columns, so that it will fit in a 24&#xFFFD;80 terminal window.</p><p>This table could be generated at runtime, on the fly.  Grinding
out the decimal and hex columns would be easy enough.  But between
wrapping the table at the right places and knowing when to print
mnemonics like NUL rather than characters, there would have been enough
odd corner cases to make the code distinctly unpleasant.  Furthermore,
the columns had to be unevenly spaced to make the table fit in 79
columns.  But any Unix programmer would reflexively express it as a block
of data before finding out these things.</p><p>The most na&#xFFFD;ve way to generate the usage screen would have been
to put each line into a C</p><p>A more sophisticated method using the string-pasting behavior of
the ANSI C</p><p>Here&apos;s the solution.  The source distribution contains a file
that just contains the usage screen, exactly as listed above and named
<tt>splashscreen</tt>. The C</p><pre class="programlisting">
void 
showHelp(FILE *out, char *progname) 
{
  fprintf(out,&quot;Usage: %s [-dxohv] [-t] [char-alias...]\n&quot;, progname);
#include &quot;splashscreen.h&quot;
  exit(0);
}
</pre><p>And <tt>splashscreen.h</tt> is generated by a makefile production:</p><pre class="programlisting">
splashscreen.h: splashscreen
        sed <splashscreen>splashscreen.h \
            -e &apos;s/\\/\\\\/g&apos; -e &apos;s/&quot;/\\&quot;/&apos; -e &apos;s/.*/puts(&quot;&amp;&quot;);/&apos; 
</splashscreen></pre><p>So when the program is built, the
<tt>splashscreen</tt> file is automatically massaged into
a series of output function calls, which are then included by the C
preprocessor in the right function.</p><p>By generating the code from data, we get to keep the editable
version of the usage screen identical to its display appearance.  This
promotes
transparency</p><p>For similar reasons, the initializer that holds the name synonym
strings is also generated via a <i>sed</i> script
in the makefile, from a file called <tt>nametable</tt> in
the <i>ascii</i> source distribution.  Most of
<tt>nametable</tt> is simply copied into the C
initializer.  But the generation process would make it easy to adapt
this tool for other 8-bit character sets such as the ISO-8859 series
(Latin-1 and friends).</p><p>This is an almost trivial example, but it nevertheless
illustrates the advantages of even simple and ad-hoc code
generation.  Similar techniques could be applied to larger
programs with correspondingly greater benefits.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="htmlgen">Case Study: Generating HTML Code for a Tabular List</a></h3></div></div><p>Let&apos;s suppose that we want to put a page of tabular data on a

</pre></a></div><p>The thick-as-a-plank way to handle this would be to hand-write
HTML table code for the desired appearance.  Then, each time we want
to add a name, we&apos;d have to hand-write another set of
<tr> and <td> tags for
the entry.  This would get very tedious very quickly.  But what&apos;s
worse, changing the format of the list would require hand-hacking
every entry.</td></tr></p><p>The superficially clever way to handle this would be to make
this data a three-column relation in a database, then use some fancy
CGI<sup>[<a id="id2941426" href="ch09s02.html#ftn.id2941426">99</a>]</sup> technique or a database-capable templating
engine like PHP to generate the page on the fly.  But suppose we know
that the list will not change very often, don&apos;t want to run a database
server just to be able to display this list, and don&apos;t want to load
the server with unnecessary CGI traffic?</p><p>There&apos;s a better solution.  We put the data in a tabular flat-file
format like <a href="ch09s02.html#colon_table" title="Example&#xFFFD;9.7.&#xFFFD;Master form of the star table.">Example&#xFFFD;9.7</a>.</p><div class="example"><a id="colon_table"><p class="title"><b>Example&#xFFFD;9.7.&#xFFFD;Master form of the star table.</b></p><pre class="screen">

delimiters, using the pattern consisting of two or more spaces as a
delimiter, but the explicit delimiter protects us in case we press
spacebar twice while editing a field value and fail to notice
it.</p><p>We then write a script in shell</p><pre class="programlisting">
sed -e &apos;s,^,<tr><td>,&apos; -e &apos;s,$,</td></tr>,&apos; -e &apos;s,:,<td>,g&apos;
</td></pre><p>or this perhaps slightly more scrutable awk(1) program:</p><pre class="programlisting">
awk -F: &apos;{printf(&quot;<tr><td>%s</td><td>%s</td><td>%s</td></tr>\n&quot;, \
                 $1, $2, $3)}&apos;
</pre><p>(If either of these examples interests but mystifies, read the
documentation for
sed(1)
or
awk(1).
We <a href="ch08s02.html#awk" title="Case Study: awk">explained</a> in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;8.&#xFFFD;Minilanguages">Chapter&#xFFFD;8</a> that the latter has largely fallen
out of use.  The former is still an important Unix tool that we
haven&apos;t examined in detail because (a) Unix programmers already know
it, and (b) it&apos;s easy for non-Unix programmers to pick up from the
manual page once they grasp the basic ideas about pipelines and
redirection.)</p><p>A new-school solution might center on this Python code, or
on equivalent Perl:</p><pre class="programlisting">
for row in map(lambda x:x.rstrip().split(&apos;:&apos;),sys.stdin.readlines()):
    print &quot;<tr><td>&quot; + &quot;</td><td>&quot;.join(row) + &quot;</td></tr>&quot;
</pre><p>These scripts took about five minutes each to write and debug,
certainly less time than would have been required to either hand-hack
the initial HTML or create and verify the database.  The combination
of the table and this code will be much simpler to maintain than
either the under-engineered hand-hacked HTML or the over-engineered
database.</p><p>A further advantage of this way of solving the problem is that
the master file stays easy to search and modify with an ordinary text
editor.  Another is that we can experiment with different
table-to-HTML transformations by tweaking the generator script, or
easily make a subset of the report by putting a
grep(1)
filter before it. </p><p>I actually use this technique to maintain the Web page that
lists
<i>fetchmail</i></p><p>This was a somewhat less trivial example than the previous
one. What we&apos;ve actually designed here is a separation between content
and formatting, with the generator script acting as a stylesheet.
(This is yet another mechanism-vs.-policy separation.)</p><p>The lesson in all these cases is the same.  Do as little work
as possible.  Let the data shape the code. Lean on your tools.
Separate mechanism from policy.  Expert Unix programmers learn to see
possibilities like these quickly and automatically.  Constructive
laziness is one of the cardinal virtues of the master programmer.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2938770" href="ch09s02.html#id2938770">98</a>] </sup>Scripting languages tend to solve this problem more
