Thompson&apos;s</p><p>The Unix philosophy is not a formal design method. It wasn&apos;t
handed down from the high fastnesses of theoretical computer
science as a way to produce theoretically perfect software. Nor is
it that perennial executive&apos;s mirage, some way to magically extract
innovative but reliable software on too short a deadline from
unmotivated, badly managed, and underpaid programmers.</p><p>The Unix philosophy (like successful folk traditions in other
engineering disciplines) is bottom-up, not top-down. It is pragmatic
and grounded in experience. It is not to be found in official methods
and standards, but rather in the implicit half-reflexive knowledge, the
<span class="emphasis"><em>expertise</em></span> that the Unix culture transmits. It
encourages a sense of proportion and skepticism &#x2014; and shows both
by having a sense of (often subversive) humor.</p><p>Doug McIlroy,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>(i) Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build
afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new
features.</p><p>(ii) Expect the output of every program to become the input to
another, as yet unknown, program. Don&apos;t clutter output with
extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input
formats. Don&apos;t insist on interactive input.</p><p>(iii) Design and build software, even operating systems, to be
tried early, ideally within weeks. Don&apos;t hesitate to throw away the
clumsy parts and rebuild them.</p><p>(iv) Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a
programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and
expect to throw some of them out after you&apos;ve finished using
them.</p></blockquote></div><p>He later summarized it this way (quoted in <i>A Quarter
Century of Unix</i> [<a href="apb.html#Salus" title="[Salus]">Salus</a>]):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one
thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write
programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal
interface.</p></blockquote></div><p>Rob Pike</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Rule 1. You can&apos;t tell where a program is going to spend its
time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don&apos;t try to second
guess and put in a speed hack until you&apos;ve proven that&apos;s where the
bottleneck
is.</p><p>Rule 2. Measure. Don&apos;t tune for speed until you&apos;ve measured, and
even then don&apos;t unless one part of the code overwhelms the
rest.</p><p>Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when <tt>n</tt> is small, and <tt>n</tt> is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big
constants. Until you know that <tt>n</tt> is
frequently going to be big, don&apos;t get fancy. (Even if <tt>n</tt> does get big, use Rule 2 first.)</p><p>Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and
they&apos;re much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as
simple data structures.</p><p><a id="rule5">Rule 5. Data dominates. If you&apos;ve chosen the right data
structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost
always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central
to programming.<sup>[<a id="id2873492" href="ch01s06.html#ftn.id2873492">9</a>]</sup></a></p><p>Rule 6.

said but by what they did and the example Unix itself set. Looking
at the whole, we can abstract the following ideas:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.</p></li><li><p>Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.</p></li><li><p>Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism;

&#x201C;one true way&#x201D;.</p></li><li><p>Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because
it will be here sooner than you think.</p></li></ol></div><p>If you&apos;re new to Unix, these principles are worth some
meditation. Software-engineering texts recommend most of them; but
most other operating systems lack the right tools and traditions to
turn them into practice, so most programmers can&apos;t apply them with
any consistency. They come to accept blunt tools, bad designs,
overwork, and bloated code as normal &#x2014; and then wonder what Unix
fans are so annoyed about.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2877537">Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.</a></h3></div></div><p>As Brian Kernighan once observed, &#x201C;Controlling complexity
is the essence of computer programming&#x201D; [<a href="apb.html#Kernighan-Plauger" title="[Kernighan-Plauger]">Kernighan-Plauger</a>]. Debugging dominates
development time, and getting a working system out the door is
usually less a result of brilliant design than it is of managing not
to trip over your own feet too many times.</p><p>Assemblers, compilers, flowcharting, procedural programming,
structured programming, &#x201C;artificial intelligence&#x201D;,
fourth-generation languages, object
orientation</p><p>The only way to write complex software that won&apos;t fall on its
face is to hold its global complexity down &#x2014; to build it out of
simple parts connected by well-defined interfaces, so that most
problems are local and you can have some hope of upgrading
a part without breaking the whole.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2877610">Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.</a></h3></div></div><p>Because maintenance is so important and so expensive, write
programs as if the most important communication they do is not to the
computer that executes them but to the human beings who will read and
maintain the source code in the future (including&#xFFFD;yourself).</p><p>In the Unix tradition, the implications of this advice go beyond
just commenting your code.  Good Unix practice also embraces choosing
your algorithms and implementations for future maintainability.  Buying a
small increase in performance with a large increase in the complexity 
and obscurity of your technique is a bad trade &#x2014; not merely because
complex code is more likely to harbor bugs, but also because complex
code will be harder to read for future maintainers.</p><p>Code that is graceful and clear, on the other hand, is less
likely to break &#x2014; and more likely to be instantly comprehended
by the next person to have to change it.  This is important,
especially when that next person might be yourself some years down the
road.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Never struggle to decipher subtle code three times.  Once might

of your programs can talk to each other.</p><p>Unix tradition strongly encourages writing programs that
read and write simple, textual, stream-oriented, device-independent
formats.  Under classic Unix, as many programs as possible are written
as simple <i>filters</i>, which take a simple text
stream on input and process it into another simple text stream on
output.</p><p>Despite popular mythology, this practice is favored not because
Unix programmers hate graphical user interfaces. It&apos;s because if you
don&apos;t write programs that accept and emit simple text streams, it&apos;s
much more difficult to hook the programs together.</p><p>Text streams are to Unix tools as messages are to objects in an
object-oriented setting. The simplicity of the text-stream interface
enforces the encapsulation of the tools.  More elaborate forms of
inter-process communication, such as remote procedure calls, show a
tendency to involve programs with each others&apos; internals too
much.</p><p>To make programs composable, make them independent.  A program
on one end of a text stream should care as little as possible about
the program on the other end.  It should be made easy to replace one
end with a completely different implementation without disturbing the
other.</p><p>GUIs can be a very good thing. Complex binary data formats are
sometimes unavoidable by any reasonable means. But before writing a
GUI, it&apos;s wise to ask if the tricky interactive parts of your
program can be segregated into one piece and the workhorse
algorithms into another, with a simple command stream or
application protocol connecting the two. Before devising a tricky
binary format to pass data around, it&apos;s worth experimenting to see
if you can make a simple textual format work and accept a little
parsing overhead in return for being able to hack the data stream
with general-purpose tools.</p><p>When a serialized, protocol-like interface is not natural for the
application, proper Unix design is to at least organize as many of the
application primitives as possible into a library with a well-defined
API.  This opens up the possibility that the application can be called
by linkage, or that multiple interfaces can be glued on it for different&#xFFFD;tasks.</p><p>(We discuss these issues in detail in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a>.)</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2877777">Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism;
separate interfaces from engines.</a></h3></div></div><p>In our discussion of what Unix gets wrong, we observed that the
designers of X</p><p>Thus, hardwiring policy and mechanism together has two bad
effects: It makes policy rigid and harder to change in response to user
requirements, and it means that trying to change policy has a strong
tendency to destabilize the mechanisms.</p><p>On the other hand, by separating the two we make it possible to
experiment with new policy without breaking mechanisms.  We also make
it much easier to write good tests for the mechanism (policy,
because it ages so quickly, often does not justify the investment).</p><p>This design rule has wide application outside the GUI
context.  In general, it implies that we should look for ways to
separate interfaces from engines.</p><p>One way to effect that separation is, for example, to write
your application as a library of C</p><p>Another way is to separate your application into cooperating
front-end and back-end processes communicating through a specialized
application protocol over sockets</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2877917">Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.</a></h3></div></div><p>Many pressures tend to make programs more complicated (and
therefore more expensive and buggy). One such pressure is technical
machismo. Programmers are bright people who are (often justly) proud
of their ability to handle complexity and juggle abstractions. Often
they compete with their peers to see who can build the most intricate
and beautiful complexities. Just as often, their ability to design
outstrips their ability to implement and debug, and the result is
expensive failure.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>The notion of &#x201C;intricate and beautiful complexities&#x201D; is
almost an oxymoron.  Unix programmers vie with each other

implicit in these rules, but is well worth making overt.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

excessive complexity comes from project requirements that are based on
the marketing fad of the month rather than the reality of what
customers want or software can actually deliver. Many a good design
has been smothered under marketing&apos;s pile of &#x201C;checklist
features&#x201D; &#x2014; features that, often, no customer will ever
use. And a vicious circle operates; the competition thinks it has to
compete with chrome by adding more chrome. Pretty soon, massive bloat
is the industry standard and everyone is using huge, buggy programs
not even their developers can love.</p><p>Either way, everybody loses in the end.</p><p>The only way to avoid these traps is to encourage a software
culture that knows that small is beautiful, that actively resists
bloat and complexity: an engineering tradition that puts a high
value on simple solutions, that looks for ways to break program systems up
into small cooperating pieces, and that reflexively fights attempts to
gussy up programs with a lot of chrome (or, even worse, to design
programs <span class="emphasis"><em>around</em></span> the chrome).</p><p>That would be a culture a lot like Unix&apos;s.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2878022">Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is
clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.</a></h3></div></div><p>&#x2018;Big&#x2019; here has the sense both of large in volume of
code and of internal complexity.  Allowing programs to get large
hurts maintainability.  Because people are reluctant to throw
away the visible product of lots of work, large programs invite
overinvestment in approaches that are failed or suboptimal.</p><p>(We&apos;ll examine the issue of the right size of software in more

inspection and debugging easier.</a></h3></div></div><p>Because debugging often occupies three-quarters or more of
development time, work done early to ease debugging can be a very
good investment. A particularly effective way to ease debugging is to
design for
<i>transparency</i></p><p>A software system is <span class="emphasis"><em>transparent</em></span> when you
can look at it and immediately understand what it is doing and how. It
is <span class="emphasis"><em>discoverable</em></span> when it has facilities for
monitoring and display of internal state so that your program not only
functions well but can be <span class="emphasis"><em>seen</em></span> to function
well.</p><p>Designing for these qualities will have implications throughout
a project. At minimum, it implies that debugging options should not be
minimal afterthoughts. Rather, they should be designed in from the
beginning &#x2014; from the point of view that the program should be
able to both demonstrate its own correctness and communicate to future
developers the original developer&apos;s mental model of the problem it
solves.</p><p>For a program to demonstrate its own correctness, it needs to be
using input and output formats sufficiently simple so that the proper
relationship between valid input and correct output is easy to
check.</p><p>The objective of designing for transparency and discoverability
should also encourage simple interfaces that can easily be manipulated
by other programs &#x2014; in particular, test and monitoring harnesses
and debugging scripts.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2878145">Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of&#xFFFD;transparency and simplicity.</a></h3></div></div><p>Software is said to be <i>robust</i> when
it performs well under unexpected conditions which stress the designer&apos;s
assumptions, as well as under normal conditions.</p><p>Most software is fragile and buggy because most programs are too
complicated for a human brain to understand all at once. When you
can&apos;t reason correctly about the guts of a program, you can&apos;t be sure
it&apos;s correct, and you can&apos;t fix it if it&apos;s broken.</p><p>It follows that the way to make robust programs is to make their
internals easy for human beings to reason about. There are two main
ways to do that:
transparency</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>For robustness, designing in tolerance for unusual or extremely
bulky inputs is also important.  Bearing in mind the Rule of
Composition helps; input generated by other programs is notorious for
stress-testing software (e.g.,&#xFFFD;the original Unix C compiler reportedly
needed small upgrades to cope well with Yacc output).  The forms
involved often seem useless to humans.  For example, accepting empty
lists/strings/etc., even in places where a human would seldom or never
supply an empty string, avoids having to special-case such situations when
generating the input mechanically.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td></tr></table></div><p>One very important tactic for being robust under odd inputs is
to avoid having special cases in your code.  Bugs often lurk in the
code for handling special cases, and in the interactions among parts
of the code intended to handle different special cases.</p><p>We observed above that software is
<i>transparent</i> when you can look at it and
immediately see what is going on. It is <span class="emphasis"><em>simple</em></span>
when what is going on is uncomplicated enough for a human brain to
reason about all the potential cases without strain.  The more
your programs have both of these qualities, the more robust they will
be.</p><p>Modularity (simple parts, clean interfaces) is a way to organize
programs to make them simpler. There are other ways to fight for
simplicity. Here&apos;s another one.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2878263">Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, 
so&#xFFFD;program logic can be stupid and robust.</a></h3></div></div><p>Even the simplest procedural logic is hard for humans to verify,
but quite complex data structures are fairly easy to model and reason
about. To see this, compare the expressiveness and explanatory power
of a diagram of (say) a fifty-node pointer tree with a flowchart of a
fifty-line program.  Or, compare an array initializer expressing a conversion
table with an equivalent switch statement. The difference in
transparency</p><p>Data is more tractable than program logic. It follows that where
you see a choice between complexity in data structures and
complexity in code, choose the former. More: in evolving a design,
you should actively seek ways to shift complexity from code to
data.</p><p>The Unix community did not originate this insight, but a lot of
Unix code displays its influence.  The

learning from the user &#x2014; or, to put it another way, the easiest
programs to use are those that most effectively connect to the user&apos;s
pre-existing knowledge.</p><p>Therefore, avoid gratuitous novelty and excessive cleverness in
interface design.  If you&apos;re writing a calculator program,

analogous programs with which your users are likely to be

programs when you can.</a></h3></div></div><p>Human beings are notoriously bad at sweating the details.
Accordingly, any kind of hand-hacking of programs is a rich source of
delays and errors. The simpler and more abstracted your program
specification can be, the more likely it is that the human designer
will have gotten it right. Generated code (at
<span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> level) is almost always cheaper and more
reliable than hand-hacked.</p><p>We all know this is true (it&apos;s why we have compilers and
interpreters, after all) but we often don&apos;t think about the
implications. High-level-language code that&apos;s repetitive and
mind-numbing for humans to write is just as productive a target for a
code generator as machine code. It pays to use code generators when
they can raise the level of abstraction &#x2014; that is, when the
specification language for the generator is simpler than the generated
code, and the code doesn&apos;t have to be hand-hacked afterwards.</p><p>In the Unix tradition, code generators are heavily used to
automate error-prone detail work. Parser/lexer generators are the
classic examples; makefile generators and GUI interface builders are
newer ones.</p><p>(We cover these techniques in <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;9.&#xFFFD;Generation">Chapter&#xFFFD;9</a>.)</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="rule_of_optimization">Rule of Optimization:
Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize
it.</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2879078">Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for 
&#x201C;one true way&#x201D;.</a></h3></div></div><p>Even the best software tools tend to be limited by the
imaginations of their designers. Nobody is smart enough to optimize
for everything, nor to anticipate all the uses to which their software
might be put. Designing rigid, closed software that won&apos;t talk
to the rest of the world is an unhealthy form of arrogance.</p><p>Therefore, the Unix tradition includes a healthy
mistrust of &#x201C;one true way&#x201D; approaches to software design or
implementation. It embraces multiple languages, open extensible
systems, and customization hooks everywhere.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2879112">Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it
will be here sooner than you think.</a></h3></div></div><p>If it is unwise to trust other people&apos;s claims for &#x201C;one
true way&#x201D;, it&apos;s even more foolish to believe them about your
own designs.  Never assume you have the final answer.  Therefore,
leave room for your data formats and code to grow; otherwise, you
will often find that you are locked into unwise early choices because
you cannot change them while maintaining backward compatibility.</p><p>When you design protocols or file formats, make them sufficiently
self-describing to be extensible.  Always, <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span>
either include a version number, or compose the format from
self-contained, self-describing clauses in such a way that new clauses
can be readily added and old ones dropped without confusing 
format-reading code.  Unix experience tells us that the marginal
extra overhead of making data layouts self-describing is paid back 
a thousandfold by the ability to evolve them forward without 
breaking things.</p><p>When you design code, organize it so future developers
will be able to plug new functions into the architecture without
having to scrap and rebuild the
architecture</p><p>You&apos;ll be there in the future too, maintaining code you may have
half forgotten under the press of more recent projects.  When you
design for the future, the sanity you save may be your own.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2873492" href="ch01s06.html#id2873492">9</a>] </sup>Pike&apos;s original adds &#x201C;(See
