Methodologist</a></h2></div></div><p>When Master Foo and his student Nubi journeyed among the sacred
sites, it was the Master&apos;s custom in the evenings to offer public
instruction to Unix neophytes of the towns and villages in which they
stopped for the night.</p><p>On one such occasion, a methodologist was among those
who gathered to listen.</p><p>&#x201C;If you do not repeatedly profile your code for hot spots
while tuning, you will be like a fisherman who casts his net in an
empty lake&#x201D;, said Master Foo.</p><p>&#x201C;Is it not, then, also true&#x201D;, said the methodology
consultant, &#x201C;that if you do not continually measure your
productivity while managing resources, you will be like a fisherman who
casts his net in an empty lake?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I once came upon a fisherman who just at that moment let
his net fall in the lake on which his boat was floating&#x201D;, said
Master Foo.  &#x201C;He scrabbled around in the bottom of his boat for
quite a while looking for it&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x201D;, said the methodologist, &#x201C;if
he had dropped his net in the lake, why was he looking in the
boat?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because he could not swim&#x201D;, replied Master Foo.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the methodologist was enlightened.</p></div>
