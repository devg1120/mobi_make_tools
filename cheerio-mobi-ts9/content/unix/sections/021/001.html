start by looking at how Unix programming style has changed over time
in the past.  This effort leads us directly to one of the challenges
of understanding the Unix style &#x2014; distinguishing between
accident and essence. That is, recognizing traits that arise from
transient technical circumstances versus those that are deeply tied to
the central Unix design challenge &#x2014; how to do modularity and
abstraction right while also keeping systems transparent and
simple.</p><p>This distinction can be difficult, because traits that arose as
accidents have sometimes turned out to have essential utility.
Consider as an example the &#x2018;Silence is golden&#x2019; rule of
Unix interface design we examined in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a>; it began as an adaptation to slow
teletypes, but continued because programs with terse output could be
combined in scripts more easily.  Today, in an environment where
having many programs running visibly through a GUI is normal, it has a
third kind of utility: silent programs don&apos;t distract or waste the
user&apos;s attention.</p><p>On the other hand, some traits that once seemed essential to
Unix turned out to be accidents tied to a particular set of cost
ratios.  For example, old-school Unix favored program designs (and
minilanguages like awk(1)) that did line-at-a-time processing of an
input stream or record-at-a-time processing of binary files, with any
context that needed to be maintained between pieces carried by
elaborate state-machine code.  New-school Unix design, on the other
hand, is generally happy with the assumption that a program can read
its entire input into memory and thereafter randomly access it at will.
Indeed, modern Unixes supply an mmap(2) call that allows the
programmer to map an entire file into virtual memory and completely
hides the serialization of I/O to and from disk space.</p><p>This change trades away storage economy to get simpler and more
transparent code.  It&apos;s an adaptation to the plunging cost of memory
relative to programmer time.  Many of the differences between
old-school Unix designs in the 1970s and 1980s and those of the new
post-1990 school can be traced to the huge shift in relative costs
that today makes all machine resources several orders of magnitude
cheaper relative to programmer time than they were in 1969.</p><p>Looking back, we can identify three specific technology changes
that have driven significant changes in Unix design style:
internetworking, bitmapped graphics displays, and the personal
computer.  In each case, the Unix tradition has adapted to the
challenge by discarding accidents that were no longer adaptive and
finding new applications for its essential ideas.  Biological
evolution works this way too.  Evolutionary biologists have a rule:
&#x201C;Don&apos;t assume that historical origin specifies current utility,
or vice versa&#x201D;. A brief look at how Unix adapted in each of
these cases may provide some clues to how Unix might adapt itself to
future technology shifts that we cannot yet anticipate.</p><p><a href="historychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;2.&#xFFFD;History">Chapter&#xFFFD;2</a> described
the first of these changes: the rise of internetworking, from the
angle of cultural history, telling how
TCP/IP</p><p>Eventually the confusion was cleared up when TCP/IP won and BSD
sockets</p><p>When bitmapped graphics and the example of the Macintosh
arrived in 1984 a few years after TCP/IP, they posed a rather more
difficult challenge.  The original GUIs from Xerox
PARC</p><p>But that was the easy part of the problem.  The hard part was
deciding whether Unix ought to have a unified interface policy at all,
and if so what it ought to be.  Several different attempts to
establish one through proprietary toolkits (like Motif) failed.  Today,
in 2003, GTK and Qt contend with each other for the role.  While the
debate on this question is not over in 2003, the persistence of
different UI styles that we noted in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a> seems telling. New-school Unix design has
kept the command line, and dealt with the tension between GUI and CLI
approaches by writing lots of CLI-engine/GUI-interface pairs that can
be used in both styles.</p><p>The personal computer posed few major design challenges as a
technology in itself.  The 386 and later chips were powerful enough to
give the systems designed around them cost ratios similar to those of
the minicomputers, workstations, and servers on which Unix matured.
The true challenge was a change in the potential market for Unix; the
much lower overall price of the hardware made personal computers
attractive to a vastly broader, less technically sophisticated user
population.</p><p>The proprietary-Unix vendors, accustomed to the fatter margins from
selling more powerful systems to sophisticated buyers, were never
interested in this wider market.  The first serious initiatives
toward the end-user desktop came out of the open-source community and
were mounted for essentially ideological reasons.  As of mid-2003,
market surveys indicate that
Linux</p><p>Whether or not Linux ever does substantially better than this,
the nature of the Unix community&apos;s response is already clear. We
examined it in the study of Linux in <a href="contrastchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;3.&#xFFFD;Contrasts">Chapter&#xFFFD;3</a>.  It includes adopting a few technologies
(such as XML) from elsewhere, and putting a lot of effort into
naturalizing GUIs into the Unix world.  But underneath the themed GUIs
and the installation packaging, the main emphasis is still on
modularity and clean code &#x2014; on getting the infrastructure for
serious, high-reliability computing and communications right.</p><p>The history of the large-scale desktop-focused developments like
Mozilla and OpenOffice.org that were launched in the late 1990s
illustrates this emphasis well.  In both these cases, the most
important theme in community feedback wasn&apos;t demand for new features
or pressure to make a ship date &#x2014; it was distaste for monster
monoliths, and a general sense that these huge programs would have to
be slimmed down, refactored, and carved into modules before they would
be other than embarrassments.</p><p>Despite being accompanied by a great deal of innovation, the
responses to all three technologies were conservative with regard to
the fundamental Unix design rules &#x2014; modularity,
transparency, separation of policy from mechanism, and the other qualities
we&apos;ve tried to characterize earlier in this book.  The learned
response of Unix programmers, reinforced over thirty years, was to go
back to first principles &#x2014; to try to get more leverage out of
Unix&apos;s basic abstractions of streams, namespaces, and processes in
preference to layering on new ones.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id3017690" href="ch20s01.html#id3017690">153</a>] </sup>For a few years it looked like ISO&apos;s 7-layer
networking standard might compete successfully with TCP/IP.  It was
promoted by a European standards committee politically horrified at
the thought of adopting any technology birthed in the bowels of the
Pentagon.  Alas, their indignation exceeded their technical acuity.
The result proved overcomplicated and unhelpful; see [<a href="apb.html#Padlipsky" title="[Padlipsky]">Padlipsky</a>] for details.</p></div></div></div>
