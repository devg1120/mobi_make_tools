its libraries, and its associated utilities were passed around as
source code; this openness was a vital part of the Unix culture.  We
described in <a href="historychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;2.&#xFFFD;History">Chapter&#xFFFD;2</a> how,
when this tradition was disrupted after 1984, Unix lost its initial
momentum. We have also described how, a decade later, the rise of the
GNU</p><p>Today, open-source code is again one of the most powerful tools
in any Unix programmer&apos;s kit. Accordingly, though the explicit concept
of &#x201C;open source&#x201D; and the most widely used
open-source</p><p>Open source</p><p>Our historical description earlier in this book chose one angle
by focusing on causal and cultural relationships between Unix and open
source.  We&apos;ll discuss the institutions and tactics of open-source
development in <a href="opensourcechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;19.&#xFFFD;Open Source">Chapter&#xFFFD;19</a>. In discussing the theory and practice
of code reuse, it&apos;s useful to think of open source more specifically,
as a direct response to the problems we dramatized in the tale of
J. Random Newbie.</p><p>Software developers want the code they use to be transparent.
Furthermore, they don&apos;t want to lose their toolkits and their
expertise when they change jobs.   They get tired of being victims, fed
up with being frustrated by blunt tools and intellectual-property
fences and having to repeatedly re-invent the wheel.</p><p>These are the motives for open source that flow from J. Random
Newbie&apos;s painful initiatory experience with reuse.  Ego needs play a
part here, too; they give pervasive emotional force to what would
otherwise be a bloodless argument about engineering best practices.
Software developers are like every other kind of craftsman and
artificer; they want, not so secretly, to be artists.  They have the
drives and needs of artists, including the desire to have an audience.
They not only want to reuse code, they want their code to be reused.
There is an imperative here that goes beyond and overrides short-term
economic goal-seeking and that cannot be satisfied by closed-source
software production.</p><p>Open source is a kind of ideological preemptive strike on all
these problems.  If the root of most of J. Random Newbie&apos;s problems
with reuse is the opacity of closed-source code, then the
institutional assumptions that produce closed-source code must be
smashed.  If corporate territoriality is a problem, it must be
attacked or bypassed until the corporations have caught on to how
self-destructive their territorial reflexes are.  Open source is what
happens when code reuse gets a flag and an army.</p><p>Accordingly, since the late 1990s, it no longer makes any
sense to try to recommend strategies and tactics for code reuse
without talking about open source, open-source practices, open-source
licensing, and the open-source community.  Even if those issues could
be separated elsewhere, they have become inextricably bound together
in the Unix world.</p><p>In the remainder of this chapter, we&apos;ll survey various issues
associated with re-using open-source code: evaluation, documentation,
and licensing. In <a href="opensourcechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;19.&#xFFFD;Open Source">Chapter&#xFFFD;19</a> we&apos;ll discuss the open-source
development model more generally, and examine the conventions you
should follow when you are releasing code for others to use.</p></div>
