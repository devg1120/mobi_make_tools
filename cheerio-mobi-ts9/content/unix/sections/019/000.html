document preparation &#x2014; Bell Labs used it to prepare patent
documents for filing.  Computer-driven phototypesetting was still a
novel idea then, and for years after it debuted in 1973 Joe Ossana&apos;s
troff(1)
formatter defined the state of the art.</p><p>Ever since, sophisticated document formatters, typesetting
software, and page-layout programs of various sorts have been an
important theme in the Unix tradition.  While
troff(1)
has proven surprisingly durable, Unix has also hosted a lot of
groundbreaking work in this application area.  Today, Unix developers
and Unix tools are at the cutting edge of far-reaching changes in
documentation practice triggered by the advent of the World Wide
Web.</p><p>At the user-presentation level, Unix-community practice has been
moving rapidly toward &#x2018;everything is HTML, all references are
URLs&#x2019; since the mid-1990s.  Increasingly, modern Unix help
browsers are simply Web browsers that know how to parse certain
specialized kinds of URLs (for example, &#x2018;man:ls(1)&#x2019;
interprets the ls(1) man page into HTML).  This relieves the problems
created by having lots of different formats for documentation masters,
but does not entirely solve them.  Documentation composers still have
to grapple with issues about which master format best meets their
particular needs.</p><p>In this chapter, we&apos;ll survey the rather unfortunate surfeit 
of different documentation formats and tools left behind by decades of
experimentation, and we&apos;ll develop guidelines for good practice
and good style.</p></div>
