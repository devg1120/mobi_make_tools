at this &#x2014; so much so that they serve as valuable documentation
of the API of modern Unix implementations.  In fact, real-world Unixes
follow published standards so closely that developers can (and
frequently do) lean more on documents like the POSIX specification
than on the official manual pages for the Unix variant they happen to
be using.</p><p>In fact, on the newer open-source Unixes (such as

was the split between the

After the release of 4.1BSD in 1980 the BSD</p><p>But another version, 1981&apos;s System III</p><p>The first attempt to bridge the gap came in February 1983 from
UniForum, an influential Unix user group.  Their Uniforum 1983 Draft
Standard (UDS 83) described a &#x201C;core Unix System&#x201D; consisting of a
subset of the System III</p><p>The 1984 divestiture of the Bell operating companies and the
beginnings of the Unix wars</p><p>During the Unix wars</p><p>In 1985,
AT&amp;T</p><p>But this would not become obvious for a few years yet;
meanwhile, the Unix wars</p><p>The lesson of this success should have been all the more pointed
because on purely logical grounds RFS was the superior model. It
supported better file-locking semantics and better mapping among user
identities on different systems, and generally made an effort to get
the finer details of Unix file system semantics precisely right,
unlike NFS. The lesson was ignored, however, even when it was repeated
in 1987 by the open-source X windowing system&apos;s</p><p>After 1985 the main thrust of Unix standardization passed to the
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE).  The IEEE&apos;s
1003 committee developed a series of standards generally known as
POSIX</p><p>Key POSIX standards include the following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">1003.1 (released 1990)</span></dt><dd><p>Library procedures.  Described the C system call API, much like
Version 7 except for signals and the terminal-control interface.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1003.2 (released 1992)</span></dt><dd><p>Standard shell and utilities. Shell semantics strongly resemble those 
of the System V Bourne shell.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1003.4 (released 1993)</span></dt><dd><p>Real-time Unix.  Binary semaphores, process memory locking,
memory-mapped files, shared memory, priority scheduling, real-time
signals, clocks and timers, IPC message passing, synchronized I/O,
asynchronous I/O, real-time files.</p><p>In the 1996 Second Edition, 1003.4 was split into 1003.1b
(real-time) and 1003.1c (threads).</p></dd></dl></div><p>Despite being underspecified in a couple of key areas such as
signal-handling semantics and omitting BSD</p><p>The next player on the scene was X/Open (later renamed the Open
Group), a consortium of Unix vendors formed in 1984.  Their X/Open
Portability Guides (XPGs) initially developed in parallel with the
POSIX drafts, then after 1990 the XPGs incorporated and extended
POSIX.  Unlike POSIX, which attempted to capture a safe subset of all
Unixes, the XPGs were oriented more toward common practice at the
leading edge; even XPG1 in 1985, spanning SVr2 and 4.2BSD,
</p><p>XPG2 in 1987 added a terminal-handling API that was essentially
System V
curses(3).
XPG3 in 1990 merged in the X11 API.  XPG4 in 1992 mandated full
compliance with the 1989 ANSI C standard</p><p>In reading about Unix standards you might come across references
to &#x201C;Spec 1170&#x201D; (from 1993), &#x201C;Unix 95&#x201D; (from
1995) and &#x201C;Unix 98&#x201D; (from 1998).  These were
certification marks based on the X/Open standards; they are now of
historical interest only.  But the work done on XPG4 turned into 
Spec 1170, which turned into the first version of the Single Unix
Specification (SUS).</p><p>In 1993 seventy-five systems and software vendors including
every major Unix company put a final end to the Unix
wars</p><p>In 2001, X/Open (now The Open Group) issued the <a href="http://www.unix.org/version3/" target="_top">Single Unix Standard version&#xFFFD;3</a>.  All the threads of Unix API standardization were finally
gathered into one bundle.  This reflected facts on the ground; the
different varieties of Unix had re-converged on a common API.  And, at
least among old-timers who remembered the turbulence of the 1980s,
there was much rejoicing.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2999310">The Ghost at the Victory Banquet</a></h3></div></div><p>There was, unfortunately, an awkward detail &#x2014; the
old-school Unix vendors who had backed the effort were under severe
pressure from the new school of open-source Unixes, and were in some
cases in the process of abandoning (in favor of
Linux</p><p>The conformance testing needed to verify Single Unix
Specification conformance is an expensive proposition.  It would need
to be done on a per-distribution basis, but is well out of the reach
of most distributors of open-source operating systems.  In any case,
Linux changes so fast that any given release of a distribution would
probably be obsolete by the time it could get
certified.<sup>[<a id="id2999345" href="ch17s02.html#ftn.id2999345">145</a>]</sup></p><p>Standards like the Single Unix Specification have not entirely lost their
relevance.  They&apos;re still valuable guides for Unix implementers.  But
how The Open Group and other institutions of the old-school Unix
standardization process will adapt to the rapid tempo of open-source
releases (and to the low- or zero-budget operation of open-source
development groups!) remains to be seen.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2999366">Unix Standards in the Open-Source World</a></h3></div></div><p>In the mid-1990s, the open-source community began
standardization efforts of its own.  These efforts built on the
source-code-level compatibility secured by
POSIX</p><p>In 1998 Oracle ported its market-leading database product to
Linux, in a move that was rightly seen as a major breakthrough in
Linux&apos;s mainstream acceptance.  The engineer in charge of the port
provided a definitive demonstration that API standards had done their
job when he was asked by a reporter what technical challenges Oracle
had had to surmount.  The engineer&apos;s reply was &#x201C;We typed
&#x2018;make&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>The problem for the new-school Unixes, therefore, was not API
compatibility at the source-code level.  Everybody took for granted
the ability to move source code between different
Linux</p><p>In the old days, each Unix had run on what was effectively its
own hardware platform.  There was enough variety in processor
instruction sets and machine architectures that applications had to be
ported at source level to move at all.  On the other hand, there were
a relatively few major Unix releases, each with relatively long
service lifetimes.  Application vendors like Oracle could afford the
cost of building and shipping separate binary distributions for each
of three or four hardware/software combinations, because they could
amortize the low cost of source-code porting over large customer
populations and a long enough product life cycle.</p><p>But then the minicomputer and workstation vendors were swamped by
inexpensive 386-based supermicros, and open-source Unixes changed the 
rules.  Vendors found they no longer had a stable platform to ship
their binaries to.</p><p>The superficial problem, at first, was the large number of Unix
distributors &#x2014; but as the Linux</p><p>The first standards effort to develop within the new-school

original 1986 trial-use standard was called IEEE-IX.  The name
&#x2018;POSIX&#x2019; was suggested by Richard Stallman. The
introduction to POSIX.1 says: &#x201C;It is expected to be pronounced
pahz-icks as in positive, not poh-six, or other variations. The
pronounciation has been published in an attempt to promulgate a
standardized way of referring to a standard operating system

out of business, because potential customers didn&apos;t
