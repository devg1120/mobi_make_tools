we contrast it with other operating systems.  Here we will attempt
only a design overview; for detailed discussion of the technical
features of different operating systems.<sup>[<a id="id2888666" href="ch03s02.html#ftn.id2888666">24</a>]</sup></p><div class="figure"><a id="os-history"><p class="title"><b>Figure&#xFFFD;3.1.&#xFFFD;Schematic history of timesharing.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/home/gusa1120/es2015/cheerio-mobi-ts9/content/unix/processed_images/os-history-grayscale.gif" alt="Schematic history of timesharing."></div></a></div><p><a href="ch03s02.html#os-history" title="Figure&#xFFFD;3.1.&#xFFFD;Schematic history of timesharing.">Figure&#xFFFD;3.1</a> indicates the genetic relationships
among the timesharing operating systems we&apos;ll survey.  A few other
operating systems (marked in gray, and not necessarily timesharing)
are included for context.  Sytems in solid boxes are still live.  The

when the system was end-of-lifed by its vendor.</p><p>Solid arrows indicate a genetic relationship or very strong
design influence (e.g., a later system with an API deliberately
reverse-engineered to match an earlier one). Dashed lines indicate
significant design influence.  Dotted lines indicate weak design
influence. Not all the genetic relationships are acknowledged by the
developers; indeed, some have been officially denied for legal or
corporate-strategy reasons but are open secrets in the
industry.</p><p>The &#x2018;Unix&#x2019; box includes all proprietary Unixes,
including both AT&amp;T and early Berkeley versions.  The
&#x2018;Linux&#x2019; box includes the open-source Unixes, all of which
launched in 1991.  They have genetic inheritance from early Unix
through code that was freed from AT&amp;T proprietary control by the
settlement of a 1993 lawsuit.<sup>[<a id="id2888778" href="ch03s02.html#ftn.id2888778">26</a>]</sup></p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="vms">VMS</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="mac_os_contrast">MacOS</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="os_2">OS/2</a></h3></div></div><p>OS/2 began life as an
IBM</p><p>Like Unix, OS/2 was built to be preemptively multitasking and
would not run on a machine without an MMU (early versions simulated an
MMU using the 286&apos;s memory segmentation).  Unlike Unix, OS/2 was never
built to be a multiuser system.  Process-spawning was relatively
cheap, but IPC was difficult and brittle.  Networking was initially
focused on LAN protocols, but a TCP/IP stack was added in later
versions.  There were no programs analogous to Unix service daemons,
so OS/2 never handled multi-function networking very well.</p><p>OS/2 had both a CLI and GUI.  Most of the positive legendry
around OS/2 was about the Workplace Shell (WPS), the OS/2 desktop.
Some of this technology was licensed from the developers of the
AmigaOS Workbench,<sup>[<a id="id2892797" href="ch03s02.html#ftn.id2892797">29</a>]</sup>
a pioneering GUI desktop that still as of 2003 has a loyal fan
base in Europe.  This is the one area of the design in which OS/2
achieved a level of capability which Unix arguably has not yet
matched.  The WPS was a clean, powerful, object-oriented design with
understandable behavior and good extensibility.  Years later it would
become a model for Linux&apos;s GNOME project.</p><p>The class-hierarchy design of WPS was one of OS/2&apos;s unifying
ideas.  The other was multithreading.  OS/2 programmers used threading
heavily as a partial substitute for IPC between peer processes.
No tradition of cooperating program toolkits developed.</p><p>OS/2 had the internal boundaries one would expect in a
single-user OS.  Running processes were protected from each other, and
kernel space was protected from user space, but there were no per-user
privilege groups. This meant the file system had no protection against
malicious code.  Another consequence was that there was no analog of a
home directory; application data tended to be scattered all over the
system.</p><p>A further consequence of the lack of multiuser capability was
that there could be no privilege distinctions in userspace.  Thus,
developers tended to trust only kernel code. Many system tasks
that in Unix would be handled by user-space daemons were jammed
into the kernel or the WPS.  Both bloated as a result.</p><p>OS/2 had a text vs. binary mode (that is, a mode in which CR/LF
was read as a single end-of-line, versus one in which no such
interpretation was performed), but no other file record structure. It
supported file attributes, which were used for desktop persistence
after the manner of the Macintosh.  System databases were mostly in
binary formats.</p><p>The preferred UI style was through the WPS. User interfaces
tended to be ergonomically better than Windows, though not up to
Macintosh standards (OS/2&apos;s most active period was relatively early in
the history of MacOS Classic</p><p>The intended audience for OS/2 was business and nontechnical
end users, implying a low tolerance for interface complexity.  It was
used both as a client operating system and as a file and print
server.</p><p>In the early 1990s, developers in the OS/2 community began to
migrate to a Unix-inspired environment called EMX that emulated
POSIX</p><p>Anyone could download EMX, which included the GNU Compiler
Collection and other open-source development tools.
IBM</p><p> After the release of Windows 95 the OS/2 community, feeling
beleaguered by Microsoft and encouraged by
IBM</p><p>OS/2 is interesting as a case study in how far a multitasking
but single-user operating-system design can be pushed.  Most of the
observations in this case study would apply well to other operating
systems of the same general type, notably
AmigaOS<sup>[<a id="id2892968" href="ch03s02.html#ftn.id2892968">30</a>]</sup> and GEM.<sup>[<a id="id2892980" href="ch03s02.html#ftn.id2892980">31</a>]</sup>  A wealth of OS/2
material is still available on the Web in 2003, including some
good histories.<sup>[<a id="id2892994" href="ch03s02.html#ftn.id2892994">32</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="nt_contrast">Windows NT</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="beos">BeOS</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="mvs">MVS</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2893777">VM/CMS</a></h3></div></div><p>VM/CMS is IBM&apos;s <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> mainframe operating
system.  Historically speaking, it is Unix&apos;s uncle: the common
ancestor is the CTSS</p><p>In another sense, VM/CMS and Unix are funhouse mirror images of
one another.  The unifying idea of the system, provided by the VM
component, is virtual machines, each of which looks exactly like the
underlying physical machine.  They are preemptively multitasked, and
run either the single-user operating system CMS or a complete
multitasking operating system (typically MVS, Linux, or another
instance of VM itself).  Virtual machines correspond to Unix
processes, daemons, and emulators, and communication between them is
accomplished by connecting the virtual card punch of one machine to
the virtual card reader of another.  In addition, a layered tools
environment called CMS Pipelines is provided within CMS, directly
modeled on Unix&apos;s pipes but architecturally extended to support
multiple inputs and outputs.</p><p>When communication between them has not been explicitly set up,
virtual machines are completely isolated from each other.  The
operating system has the same high reliability, scalability, and
security as MVS, and has far greater flexibility and is much easier to
use.  In addition, the kernel-like portions of CMS do not need to be
trusted by the VM component, which is maintained completely
separately.</p><p>Although CMS is record-oriented, the records are essentially
equivalent to the lines that Unix textual tools use.  Databases are
much better integrated into CMS Pipelines than is typically the case
on Unix, where most databases are quite separate from the operating
system.  In recent years, CMS has been augmented to fully support the
Single Unix Specification.</p><p>The UI style of CMS is interactive and conversational, very
unlike MVS but like VMS and Unix.  A full-screen editor called XEDIT
is heavily used.</p><p>VM/CMS predates the client/server distinction, and is nowadays
used almost entirely as a server operating system with emulated IBM
terminals.  Before Windows came to dominate the desktop so completely,
VM/CMS provided word-processing services and email both internally to
IBM and between mainframe customer sites &#x2014; indeed, many VM systems
were installed exclusively to run those applications because of VM&apos;s
ready scalability to tens of thousands of users.</p><p>A scripting language called Rexx supports programming in a style
not unlike shell, awk, Perl or Python.  Consequently, casual
programming (especially by system administrators) is very important on
VM/CMS.  Free cycles permitting, admins often prefer to run production
MVS in a virtual machine rather than directly on the bare iron, so
that CMS is also available and its flexibility can be taken advantage
of.  (There are CMS tools that permit access to MVS
file systems.)</p><p>There are even striking parallels between the history of VM/CMS
within IBM and Unix within Digital Equipment Corporation (which made
the hardware that Unix first ran on).  It took IBM years to understand
the strategic importance of its unofficial timesharing system, and
during that time a community of VM/CMS programmers arose that was
closely analogous in behavior to the early Unix community.  They
shared ideas, shared discoveries about the system, and above all
shared source code for utilities.  No matter how often IBM tried to
declare VM/CMS dead, the community &#x2014; which included IBM&apos;s own
MVS system developers! &#x2014; insisted on keeping it alive.  VM/CMS
even went through the same cycle of de facto open source to closed
source back to open source, though not as thoroughly as Unix
did.</p><p>What VM/CMS lacks, however, is any real analog to C.  Both VM
and CMS were written in assembler and have remained so implemented.
The nearest equivalent to C was various cut-down versions of PL/I that
IBM used for systems programming, but did not share with its
customers.  Therefore, the operating system remains trapped on its
original architectural line, though it has grown and expanded as the
360 architecture became the 370 series, the XA series, and finally the
current z/Series.</p><p>Since the year 2000, IBM has been promoting VM/CMS on mainframes
to an unprecedented degree &#x2014; as ways to host thousands of
virtual Linux machines at once.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="linux">Linux</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2888666" href="ch03s02.html#id2888666">24</a>] </sup>See the <a href="http://www.osdata.com/" target="_top">OSData website</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2888745" href="ch03s02.html#id2888745">25</a>] </sup>Except
