organization is the best.  The remainder of this chapter will present
IPC techniques roughly in order of escalating complexity of
programming them.  Before using a later, more complex technique, you
should prove by demonstration &#x2014; with prototypes and benchmark
results &#x2014; that no earlier and simpler technique will do.  Often
you will surprise yourself.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2915475">Handing off Tasks to Specialist Programs</a></h3></div></div><p>In the simplest form of interprogram cooperation enabled by
inexpensive process spawning, a program runs another to accomplish a
specialized task. Because the called program is often specified as a
Unix shell command through the
system(3)
call, this is often called <span class="emphasis"><em>shelling out</em></span> to the
called program. The called program inherits the user&apos;s keyboard and
display and runs to completion. When it exits, the calling program
resumes control of the keyboard and display and resumes
execution.<sup>[<a id="id2915505" href="ch07s02.html#ftn.id2915505">68</a>]</sup> Because the calling program does not
communicate with the called program during the callee&apos;s execution,
protocol design is not an issue in this kind of cooperation,
except in the trivial sense that the caller may pass command-line
arguments to the callee to change its behavior.</p><p>The classic Unix case of shelling out is calling an editor from
within a mail or news program. In the Unix tradition one does
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> bundle purpose-built editors into programs
that require general text-edited input. Instead, one allows the user
to specify an editor of his or her choice to be called when editing
needs to be done.</p><p>The specialist program usually communicates with its parent through the
file system, by reading or modifying file(s) with specified
location(s); this is how editor or mailer shellouts work.</p><p>In a common variant of this pattern, the specialist program may
accept input on its standard input, and be called with the
C</p><p>They key point about all these cases is that the specialist
programs don&apos;t handshake with the parent while they are running.  They
have an associated protocol only in the trivial sense that whichever
program (master or slave) is accepting input from the other has to be
able to parse it.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2915594">Case Study: The <i>mutt</i> Mail User Agent</a></h4></div></div><p>The <i>mutt</i></p><p>When you use
<i>mutt</i></p><p>Almost all Unix mail- and netnews-composition programs observe
the same convention. Because they do, composer implementers don&apos;t
need to write a hundred inevitably diverging editors, and users
don&apos;t need to learn a hundred divergent interfaces.  Instead, users
can carry their chosen editors with them.</p><p>An important variant of this strategy shells out to a small proxy
program that passes the specialist job to an already-running instance
of a big program, like an editor or a Web browser.  Thus, developers
who normally have an instance of <i>emacs</i>
running on their X display can set
<b>EDITOR=emacsclient</b>, and have a buffer pop open in
their <i>emacs</i> when they request editing in
<i>mutt</i>.  The point of this is not really to
save memory or other resources, it&apos;s to enable the user to unify all
editing in a single <i>emacs</i> process (so that,
for example, cut and paste among buffers can carry along internal
<i>emacs</i> state information like font
highlighting).</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="plumbing">Pipes, Redirection, and Filters</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2921506">Wrappers</a></h3></div></div><p>The opposite of a shellout is a <span class="emphasis"><em>wrapper</em></span>. A
wrapper creates a new interface for a called program, or specializes
it.  Often, wrappers are used to hide the details of elaborate shell
pipelines</p><p>As with shellouts, there is no associated protocol because the
programs do not communicate during the execution of the callee; but
the wrapper usually exists to specify arguments that modify the
callee&apos;s behavior.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2921550">Case Study: Backup Scripts</a></h4></div></div><p>Specialization wrappers are a classic use of the Unix shell and
other scripting languages</p><pre class="programlisting">
tar -czvf /dev/st0 &quot;$@&quot;
</pre><p>This is a wrapper for the
tar(1)
tape archiver utility which simply supplies one fixed argument (the
tape device <tt>/dev/st0</tt>) and passes to tar all the other arguments
supplied by the user (&#x201C;<tt>$@</tt>&#x201D;).<sup>[<a id="id2921610" href="ch07s02.html#ftn.id2921610">71</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2921634">Security Wrappers and Bernstein Chaining</a></h3></div></div><p>One common use of wrapper scripts is as <i>security
wrappers</i>.  A security script may call a gatekeeper program
to check some sort of credential, then conditionally execute another
based on the status value returned by the gatekeeper.</p><p>Bernstein chaining is a specialized security-wrapper technique
first invented by Daniel J. Bernstein, who has employed it in a number
of his packages. (A similar pattern appears in commands like
nohup(1)
and
su(1),
but the conditionality is absent.)  Conceptually, a Bernstein chain is
like a pipeline</p><p>The usual application is to confine security-privileged
applications to some sort of gatekeeper program, which can then hand
state to a less privileged one.  The technique pastes several programs
together using execs, or possibly a combination of forks and
execs. The programs are all named on one command line. Each program
performs some function and (if successful) runs
exec(2)
on the rest of its command line.</p><p>Bernstein&apos;s <i>rblsmtpd</i> package is a
prototypical example. It serves to look up a host in the antispam DNS
zone of the Mail Abuse Prevention System. It does this by doing a DNS
query on the IP address passed into it in the
<tt>TCPREMOTEIP</tt> environment variable.  If the query is
successful, then <i>rblsmtpd</i> runs its own SMTP
that discards the mail. Otherwise the remaining command-line arguments
are presumed to constitute a mail transport agent that knows the SMTP
protocol, and are handed to
exec(2)
to be run.</p><p>Another example can be found in Bernstein&apos;s
<i>qmail</i> package. It contains a program called
<i>condredirect</i>. The first parameter is an
email address, and the remainder a gatekeeper program and
arguments. <i>condredirect</i> forks and execs the
gatekeeper with its arguments. If the gatekeeper exits successfully, 
<i>condredirect</i> forwards the email
pending on stdin to the specified email address.  In this case,
opposite to that of <i>rblsmtpd</i>, the security
decision is made by the child; this case is a bit more like a
classical shellout.</p><p>A more elaborate example is the <i>qmail</i>
POP3 server. It consists of three programs,
<i>qmail-popup</i>,
<i>checkpassword</i>, and
<i>qmail-pop3d</i>.
<i>Checkpassword</i> comes from a separate package
cleverly called <i>checkpassword</i>, and
unsurprisingly it checks the password. The POP3 protocol has an
authentication phase and mailbox phase; once you enter the mailbox
phase you cannot go back to the authentication phase. This is a
perfect application for Bernstein chaining.</p><p>The first parameter of <i>qmail-popup</i> is
the hostname to use in the POP3 prompts. The rest of its parameters
are forked and passed to
exec(2),
after the POP3 username and password have been fetched. If the program
returns failure, the password must be wrong, so
<i>qmail-popup</i> reports that and waits for a
different password. Otherwise, the program is presumed to have
finished the POP3 conversation, so
<i>qmail-popup</i> exits.</p><p>The program named on <i>qmail-popup</i>&apos;s
command line is expected to read three null-terminated strings from
file descriptor 3.<sup>[<a id="id2921897" href="ch07s02.html#ftn.id2921897">72</a>]</sup>  These are the username, password, and response to
a cryptographic challenge, if any.  This time it&apos;s
<i>checkpassword</i> which accepts as parameters
the name of <i>qmail-pop3d</i> and its
parameters. The <i>checkpassword</i> program exits
with failure if the password does not match; otherwise it changes to
the user&apos;s uid, gid, and home directory, and executes the rest of its
command line on behalf of that user.</p><p>Bernstein chaining is useful for situations in which the
application needs setuid or setgid privileges to initialize a
connection, or to acquire some credential, and then drop those
privileges so that following code does not have to be trusted.
Following the exec, the child program cannot set its real user ID back
to root. It&apos;s also more flexible than a single process, because you
can modify the behavior of the system by inserting another program
into the chain.</p><p>For example, <i>rblsmtpd</i> (mentioned
above) can be inserted into a Bernstein chain, in between tcpserver
(from the <i>ucspi-tcp</i> package) and the real
SMTP server, typically
<i>qmail-smtpd</i>. However, it works with
inetd(8)
and <b>sendmail -bs</b> as well.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2922002">Slave Processes</a></h3></div></div><p>Occasionally, child programs both accept data from and return
data to their callers through
pipes</p><p>Unix&apos;s
popen(3)
call can set up either an input pipe or an output pipe for a shellout,
but not both for a slave process &#x2014; this seems intended to
encourage simpler programming. And, in fact, interactive master-slave
communication is tricky enough that it is normally only used when
either (a) the implied protocol is utterly trivial, or (b) the slave
process has been designed to speak an application protocol along the
lines we discussed in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a>.  We&apos;ll return to this issue, and ways
to cope with it, in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;8.&#xFFFD;Minilanguages">Chapter&#xFFFD;8</a>.</p><p>When writing a master/slave pair, it is good practice for the
master to support a command-line switch or environment variable that
allows callers to set their own slave command.  Among other things,
this is useful for debugging; you will often find it handy during 
development to invoke the real slave process from within a harness
that monitors and logs transactions between slave and master.</p><p>If you find that master/slave interactions in your program are
becoming nontrivial, it may be time to think about going the rest of
the way to a more peer-to-peer organization, using techniques like
sockets or shared memory.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2922085">Case Study: <i>scp</i> and <i>ssh</i></a></h4></div></div><p>One common case in which the implied protocol really is trivial is
progress meters.  The
scp(1)
secure-copy command calls
ssh(1)
as a slave process, intercepting enough information from ssh&apos;s
standard output to reformat the reports as an ASCII animation of a
progress bar.<sup>[<a id="id2922127" href="ch07s02.html#ftn.id2922127">73</a>]</sup>
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2922148">Peer-to-Peer Inter-Process Communication</a></h3></div></div><p>All the communication methods we&apos;ve discussed so far have a sort
of implicit hierarchy about them, with one program effectively
controlling or driving another and zero or limited feedback passing in
the opposite direction. In communications and networking we frequently
need channels that are <span class="emphasis"><em>peer-to-peer</em></span>, usually (but
not necessarily) with data flowing freely in both directions. We&apos;ll
survey peer-to-peer communications methods under Unix here, and
develop some case studies in later chapters.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2922172">Tempfiles</a></h4></div></div><p>The use of tempfiles as communications drops between
cooperating programs is the oldest IPC technique there is.  Despite
drawbacks, it&apos;s still useful in shellscripts, and in one-off programs
where a more elaborate and coordinated method of communication would
be overkill.</p><p>The most obvious problem with using tempfiles as an IPC
technique is that it tends to leave garbage lying around if processing
is interrupted before the tempfile can be deleted. A less obvious risk
is that of collisions between multiple instances of a program using
the same name for a tempfile. This is why it is conventional for
shellscripts that make tempfiles to include $$ in their names; this
shell variable expands to the process-ID of the enclosing shell and
effectively guarantees that the filename will be unique (the same 
trick is supported in Perl).</p><p>Finally, if an attacker knows the location to which a tempfile
will be written, it can overwrite on that name and possibly either read
the producer&apos;s data or spoof the consumer process by inserting
modified or spurious data into the file.<sup>[<a id="id2922208" href="ch07s02.html#ftn.id2922208">74</a>]</sup>
This is a security risk.  If the processes involved have root
privileges, this is a very serious risk.  It can be mitigated by setting
the permissions on the tempfile directory carefully, but such
arrangements are notoriously likely to spring leaks.</p><p>All these problems aside, tempfiles still have a niche because
they&apos;re easy to set up, they&apos;re flexible, and they&apos;re less vulnerable
to deadlocks or race conditions than more elaborate methods. And
sometimes, nothing else will do.  The calling conventions of your
child process may require that it be handed a file to operate on.  Our
first example of a shellout to an editor demonstrates this
perfectly.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2922239">Signals</a></h4></div></div><p>The simplest and crudest way for two processes on the same
machine to communicate with each other is for one to send the other a
<span class="emphasis"><em>signal</em></span>. Unix signals are a form of soft
interrupt; each one has a default effect on the receiving process
(usually to kill it). A process can declare a <span class="emphasis"><em>signal
handler</em></span> that overrides the default action for the signal; the
handler is a function that is executed asynchronously when the signal
is received.</p><p>Signals were originally designed into Unix as a way for the
operating system to notify programs of certain errors and critical
events, not as an IPC facility. The <tt>SIGHUP</tt> signal,
for example, is sent to every program started from a given terminal
session when that session is terminated. The <tt>SIGINT</tt>
signal is sent to whatever process is currently attached to the
keyboard when the user enters the currently-defined interrupt
character (often control-C). Nevertheless, signals can be useful for
some IPC situations (and the POSIX-standard signal set includes two
signals, <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> and <tt>SIGUSR2</tt>,
intended for this
use)</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>I insisted <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> and <tt>SIGUSR2</tt> be invented for BSD. People

will write a small file to a known location (often in

conditions<sup>[<a id="id2922479" href="ch07s02.html#ftn.id2922479">75</a>]</sup> or anomalies. Depending on what
variant of signals semantics the system supports, the second and later
instances may be ignored, may cause an unexpected process kill, or may
have their delivery delayed until earlier instances have been

<span class="emphasis"><em>protocol family</em></span> which tells the network layer how
the name of the socket is interpreted. Sockets are usually thought of
in connection with the Internet, as a way of passing data between
programs running on different hosts; this is the AF_INET socket
family, in which addresses are interpreted as host-address and
service-number pairs. However, the AF_UNIX (aka AF_LOCAL) protocol
family supports the same socket abstraction for communication between
two processes on the same machine (names are interpreted as the
locations of special files analogous to bidirectional named pipes). As

succinct way.  We&apos;ve already discussed the some major issues in the

implemented as a monster monolith, it would be a single program with
an interactive interface that manipulates database files on disk
directly.  Interface would be welded together with implementation, and
two instances of the program attempting to manipulate the same
database at the same time would have serious contention and locking
issues.</p><p>Instead, the PostgreSQL suite includes a server called

applications.  One <i>postmaster</i> server
process per machine runs in background and has exclusive access to the

stored.  Clients can be specialized for different needs and have
different user interfaces.</p><p>This organization is quite typical for Unix databases &#x2014; so

different machines (and, in fact, be separated by an Internet
connection spanning half the globe), shared memory requires producers
and consumers to be co-resident on the same hardware.  But, if your
communicating processes can get access to the same physical memory,
shared memory will be the fastest way to pass information between
them.</p><p>Shared memory may be disguised under different APIs, but on
modern Unixes the implementation normally depends on the use of
mmap(2)
to map files into memory that can be shared between processes.
POSIX</p><p>Because access to shared memory is not automatically serialized
by a discipline resembling read and write calls, programs doing the
sharing must handle contention and deadlock issues themselves,
typically by using semaphore variables located in the shared segment.
The issues here resemble those in multithreading (see the end of this
chapter for discussion) but are more manageable because default is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to share memory. Thus, problems are better
contained.</p><p>On systems where it is available and reliable, the
Apache</p><p>The
mmap(2)
call is supported under all modern Unixes, including
Linux</p><p>Before purpose-built
mmap(2)
was available, a common way for two processes to communicate was for
them to open the same file, and then delete that file.  The file
wouldn&apos;t go away until all open filehandles were closed, but some old
Unixes took the link count falling to zero as a hint that they could
stop updating the on-disk copy of the file.  The downside was that
your backing store was the file system rather than a swap device,
the file system the deleted file lived on couldn&apos;t be unmounted until the
programs using it closed, and attaching new processes to an existing
shared memory segment faked up in this way was tricky at best.</p><p>After Version 7 and the split between the
BSD</p><p>The upper, message-passing layer of System V IPC has largely
fallen out of use.  The lower layer, which consists of shared memory
and semaphores, still has significant applications under circumstances
in which one needs to do mutual-exclusion locking and some global data
sharing among processes running on the same machine.  These System V
shared memory facilities evolved into the POSIX shared-memory API,
supported under Linux, the BSDs, MacOS X and Windows, but not classic
MacOS.</p><p>By using these shared-memory and semaphore facilities
(shmget(2),
semget(2),
and friends) one can avoid the overhead of copying data through the
network stack.  Large commercial databases (including Oracle, DB2, Sybase, and
Informix) use this technique heavily.  </p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2915505" href="ch07s02.html#id2915505">68</a>] </sup>A common error in programming shellouts is to

difficult to debug.</p></div></div></div>
