      <p>In recent years, disk space has become outrageously cheap
      and abundant, but network bandwidth has not.  Therefore, the
      Subversion working copy has been optimized around the scarcer
      resource.</p>
      <p>The <code class="filename">.svn</code> administrative directory
      serves the same purpose as the <code class="filename">CVS</code>
      directory, except that it also stores read-only,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pristine</span>”</span> copies of your files.  This allows you
      to do many things offline:</p>

      <p>Also, the cached pristine files allow the Subversion client
      to send differences when committing, which CVS cannot do.</p>
      <p>The last subcommand in the list—<span class="command"><strong>svn
      revert</strong></span>—is new.  It will not only remove local
      changes, but also unschedule operations such as adds and
      deletes.  Although deleting the file and then running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
      update</code></strong> will still work, doing so distorts the true
      purpose of updating.  And, while we're on this subject…</p>
