      <p>Subversion is built on a portability layer called
      APR&#x2014;the Apache Portable Runtime library.  The APR library
      provides all the interfaces that Subversion needs to function on
      different operating systems: disk access, network access, memory
      management, and so on.  While Subversion is able to use Apache
      HTTP Server (or, <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span>) as one of its network
      server programs, its dependence on APR <span class="emphasis"><em>does
      not</em></span> mean that <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> is a required
      component.  APR is a standalone library usable by any
      application.  It does mean, however, that Subversion clients and
      servers run on any operating system
      that <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> runs on: Windows, Linux, all
      flavors of BSD, Mac OS X, NetWare, and others.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to get Subversion is to download a binary
      package built for your operating system.  Subversion&apos;s web site
      (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org</a>) often has these
      packages available for download, posted by volunteers.  The site
      usually contains graphical installer packages for users of
      Microsoft operating systems.  If you run a Unix-like operating
      system, you can use your system&apos;s native package distribution
      system (RPMs, DEBs, the ports tree, etc.) to get
      Subversion.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can build Subversion directly from source
      code, though it&apos;s not always an easy task. (If you&apos;re not
      experienced at building open source software packages, you&apos;re
      probably better off downloading a binary distribution instead!)
      From the Subversion web site, download the latest source code
      release.  After unpacking it, follow the instructions in
      the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file to build it.</p>
      <p>If you&apos;re one of those folks that likes to use bleeding-edge
      software, you can also get the Subversion source code from the
      Subversion repository in which it lives.  Obviously, you&apos;ll need
      to already have a Subversion client on hand to do this.  But
      once you do, you can check out a working copy from
      <a class="ulink" href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion" target="_top">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion</a><a href="#ftn.idm14695" class="footnote" id="idm14695"><sup class="footnote">[73]</sup></a>:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk subversion
A    subversion/HACKING
A    subversion/INSTALL
A    subversion/README
A    subversion/autogen.sh
A    subversion/build.conf
&#x2026;
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The preceding command will create a working copy of the
      latest (unreleased) Subversion source code into a subdirectory
      named <code class="filename">subversion</code> in your current working
      directory.  You can adjust that last argument as you see fit.
      Regardless of what you call the new working copy directory,
      though, after this operation completes, you will now have the
      Subversion source code.  Of course, you will still need to fetch
      a few helper libraries (apr, apr-util, etc.)&#x2014;see the
      <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file in the top level of the
      working copy for details.</p>
