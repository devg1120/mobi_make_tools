<h3 id="in-the-compiler">In the Compiler<a href="#in-the-compiler" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h3><p>In addition to normal assets, the compiler needs to emit an &quot;update&quot; to allow updating from the previous version to the new version. The &quot;update&quot; consists of two parts:</p><ol>
<li>The updated <a href="/concepts/manifest">manifest</a> (JSON)</li>
<li>One or more updated chunks (JavaScript)</li>
</ol><p>The manifest contains the new compilation hash and a list of all updated chunks. Each of these chunks contains the new code for all updated modules (or a flag indicating that the module was removed).</p><p>The compiler ensures that module IDs and chunk IDs are consistent between these builds. It typically stores these IDs in memory (e.g. with <a href="/configuration/dev-server/">webpack-dev-server</a>), but it&apos;s also possible to store them in a JSON file.</p>
