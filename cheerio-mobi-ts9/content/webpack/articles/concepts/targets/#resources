<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheLarkInn/compare-webpack-target-bundles">compare-webpack-target-bundles</a></strong>: A great resource for testing and viewing different webpack <em>targets</em>. Also great for bug reporting.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate">Boilerplate of Electron-React Application</a></strong>: A good example of a build process for electron&apos;s main process and renderer process.</li>
</ul><blockquote class="todo">
<p>Need to find up to date examples of these webpack targets being used in live code or boilerplates.</p>
