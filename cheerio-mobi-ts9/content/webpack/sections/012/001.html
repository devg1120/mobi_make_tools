<h2 id="runtime">Runtime<a href="#runtime" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2><p>The runtime, along with the manifest data, is basically all the code webpack needs to connect your modularized application while it&apos;s running in the browser. It contains the loading and resolving logic needed to connect your modules as they interact. This includes connecting modules that have already been loaded into the browser as well as logic to lazy-load the ones that haven&apos;t.</p>
