      <p>It goes without saying that this book exists to be a source
      of information and assistance for Subversion users new and old.
      Conveniently, though, the Subversion command-line is
      self-documenting, alleviating the need to grab a book off the
      shelf (wooden, virtual, or otherwise).  The <span class="command"><strong>svn
      help</strong></span> command is your gateway to that built-in
      documentation:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn help
Subversion command-line client, version 1.7.0.
Type &apos;svn help <subcommand>&apos; for help on a specific subcommand.
Type &apos;svn --version&apos; to see the program version and RA modules
  or &apos;svn --version --quiet&apos; to see just the version number.
Most subcommands take file and/or directory arguments, recursing
on the directories.  If no arguments are supplied to such a
command, it recurses on the current directory (inclusive) by default.
Available subcommands:
   add
   blame (praise, annotate, ann)
   cat
&#x2026;
</subcommand></pre>
      </div>
      <p>As described in the previous output, you can ask for help on
      a particular subcommand by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help
      <em class="replaceable"><code>SUBCOMMAND</code></em></code></strong>.  Subversion
      will respond with the full usage message for that subcommand,
      including its syntax, options, and behavior:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn help help
help (?, h): Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
usage: help [SUBCOMMAND...]
Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG
&#x2026;
</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <p class="title">
                <strong>Options and Switches and Flags, Oh My!</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion command-line client has numerous command
        modifiers.  Some folks refer to such things
        as <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">switches</span>&#x201D;</span> or <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">flags</span>&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;in
        this book, we&apos;ll call them <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">options</span>&#x201D;</span>.  You&apos;ll
        find the options supported by a given <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        subcommand, plus a set of options which are globally supported
        by all subcommands, listed near the bottom of the built-in
        usage message for that subcommand.</p>
        <p>Subversion&apos;s options have two distinct forms:  short
        options are a single hyphen followed by a single letter, and
        long options consist of two hyphens followed by several
        letters and hyphens (e.g., <code class="literal">-s</code>
        and <code class="literal">--this-is-a-long-option</code>, respectively).
        Every option has at least one long format.  Some, such as
        the <code class="option">--changelist</code> option, feature an
        abbreviated long-format alias (<code class="option">--cl</code>, in this
        case).  Only certain options&#x2014;generally the most-used
        ones&#x2014;have an additional short format.  To maintain
        clarity in this book, we usually use the long form in code
        examples, but when describing options, if there&apos;s a short
        form, we&apos;ll provide the long form (to improve clarity) and the
        short form (to make it easier to remember).  Use the form
        you&apos;re more comfortable with when executing your own
        Subversion commands.</p>

      <p>Many Unix-based distributions of Subversion include manual
      pages of the sort that can be invoked using
      the <span class="command"><strong>man</strong></span> program, but those tend to carry only
      pointers to other sources of real help, such as the project&apos;s
      website and to the website which hosts this book.  Also, several
      companies offer Subversion help and support, too, usually via a
      mixture of web-based discussion forums and fee-based consulting.
      And of course, the Internet holds a decade&apos;s worth of
      Subversion-related discussions just begging to be located by
      your favorite search engine.  Subversion help is never too far
      away.</p>
