        <p>svn delete (del, remove, rm) &#x2014; Delete an item from a working copy
            or the repository.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Items specified by <em class="replaceable"><code>PATH</code></em> are
            scheduled for deletion upon the next commit.  Files (and
            directories that have not been committed) are immediately
            removed from the working copy unless the
            <code class="option">--keep-local</code> option is given.  The
            command will not remove any unversioned or modified items;
            use the <code class="option">--force</code> option to override this
            behavior.</p>
        <p>Items specified by URL are deleted from
            the repository via an immediate commit.  Multiple URLs are
            committed atomically.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Using <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> to delete a file from
            your working copy deletes your local copy of the file, but
            it merely schedules the file to be deleted from the
            repository.  When you commit, the file is deleted in the
            repository.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn delete myfile
D         myfile
$ svn commit -m &quot;Deleted file &apos;myfile&apos;.&quot;
Deleting       myfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 14.
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Deleting a URL, however, is immediate, so you have
            to supply a log message:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn delete -m &quot;Deleting file &apos;yourfile&apos;&quot; \
             file:///var/svn/repos/test/yourfile
Committed revision 15.
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Here&apos;s an example of how to force deletion of a file
            that has local mods:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn delete over-there 
svn: E195006: Use --force to override this restriction (local modifications m\
ay be lost)
svn: E195006: &apos;/home/sally/project/over-there&apos; has local modifications -- com\
mit or revert them first
$ svn delete --force over-there 
D         over-there
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Use the <code class="option">--keep-local</code> option to
            override the default <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span>
            behavior of also removing the target file that was
            scheduled for versioned deletion.  This is helpful when
            you realize that you&apos;ve accidentally committed the
            addition of a file that you need to keep around in your
            working copy, but which shouldn&apos;t have been added to
            version control.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn delete --keep-local conf/program.conf
D         conf/program.conf
$ svn commit -m &quot;Remove accidentally-added configuration file.&quot;
