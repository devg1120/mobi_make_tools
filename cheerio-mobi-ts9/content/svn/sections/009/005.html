      <p>Sometimes there&apos;s a single right way to do things; sometimes
      there are many.  Subversion&apos;s developers understand that while
      the majority of its exact behaviors are acceptable to most of
      its users, there are some corners of its functionality where
      such a universally pleasing approach doesn&apos;t exist.  In those
      places, Subversion offers users the opportunity to tell it how
      <span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> want it to behave.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, we explored Subversion&apos;s runtime
      configuration system and other mechanisms by which users can
      control those configurable behaviors.  If you are a developer,
      though, the next chapter will take you one step further.  It
      describes how you can further customize your Subversion
      experience by writing your own software against Subversion&apos;s
      libraries.</p>
