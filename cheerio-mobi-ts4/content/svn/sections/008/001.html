      <p>Subversion was designed with an abstract repository access layer.
      This means that a repository can be programmatically accessed by
      any sort of server process, and the client <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">repository
      access</span>&#x201D;</span> API allows programmers to write plug-ins that
      speak relevant network protocols.  In theory, Subversion can use
      an infinite number of network implementations.  In practice,
      there are only two Subversion servers in widespread use today.</p>
      <p>Apache is an extremely popular web server; using the
      <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module, Apache can access a
      repository and make it available to clients via the
      WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an extension of HTTP.  Because
      Apache is an extremely extensible server, it provides a number
      of features <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">for free,</span>&#x201D;</span> such as encrypted SSL
      communication, logging, integration with a number of third-party
      authentication systems, and limited built-in web browsing of
      repositories.</p>
      <p>In the other corner is <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>: a small,
      lightweight server program that speaks a custom protocol with
      clients.  Because its protocol is explicitly designed for
      Subversion and is stateful (unlike HTTP), it provides
      significantly faster network operations&#x2014;but at the cost of
      some features as well.  While it can use SASL to provide a
      variety of authentication and encryption options, it has no
      logging or built-in web browsing.  It is, however, extremely
      easy to set up and is often the best option for small teams just
      starting out with Subversion.</p>
      <p>The network protocol which <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
      speaks may also be tunneled over an SSH connection.  This
      deployment option for <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> differs quite
      a bit in features from a traditional <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
      deployment.  SSH is used to encrypt all communication.  SSH is
      also used exclusively to authenticate, so real system accounts
      are required on the server host (unlike
      vanilla <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, which has its own private
      user accounts).  Finally, because this setup requires that each
      user spawn a private, temporary <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
      process, it&apos;s equivalent (from a permissions point of view) to
      allowing a group of local users to all access the repository
      via <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs.  Path-based access control
      has no meaning, since each user is accessing the repository
      database files directly.</p>
      <p> provides a
      quick summary of the three typical server deployments.</p>
