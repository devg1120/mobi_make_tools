      <p>A Subversion repository can be accessed simultaneously by
    clients running on the same machine on which the repository
    resides using URLs carrying the <code class="literal">file://</code> scheme.
    But the typical Subversion setup involves a single server machine
    being accessed from clients on computers all over the
    office&#x2014;or, perhaps, all over the world.</p>
      <p>This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository
    exposed outside its host machine for use by remote clients.  We
    will cover Subversion&apos;s currently available server mechanisms,
    discussing the configuration and use of each.  After reading this
    chapter, you should be able to decide which networking setup is
    right for your needs, as well as understand how to enable such a
    setup on your host computer.</p>
