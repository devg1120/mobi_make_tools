      <p>If you&apos;ve been reading this book chapter by chapter, from
    start to finish, you should by now have acquired enough
    knowledge to use the Subversion client to perform the most
    common version control operations.  You understand how to
    check out a working copy from a Subversion repository.  You are
    comfortable with submitting and receiving changes using the
    <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
    operations.  You&apos;ve probably even developed a reflex that causes
    you to run the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> command almost
    unconsciously.  For all intents and purposes, you are ready to
    use Subversion in a typical environment.</p>
      <p>But the Subversion feature set doesn&apos;t stop at <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">common
    version control operations.</span>&#x201D;</span>  It has other bits of
    functionality besides just communicating file and
    directory changes to and from a central repository.</p>
      <p>This chapter highlights some of Subversion&apos;s features that,
    while important, may not be part of the typical user&apos;s daily routine.
    It assumes that you are familiar with Subversion&apos;s basic file and
    directory versioning capabilities.  If you aren&apos;t, you&apos;ll want to
    first read  and .  Once you&apos;ve mastered those basics and
    consumed this chapter, you&apos;ll be a Subversion power user!</p>
