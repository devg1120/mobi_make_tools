      <p>By default, most Subversion operations on directories act in
      a recursive manner.  For example, <span class="command"><strong>svn
      checkout</strong></span> creates a working copy with every file and
      directory in the specified area of the repository, descending
      recursively through the repository tree until the entire
      structure is copied to your local disk.  Subversion 1.5
      introduces a feature called <em class="firstterm">sparse
      directories</em> (or <em class="firstterm">shallow
      checkouts</em>) that allows you to easily check out a
      working copy&#x2014;or a portion of a working copy&#x2014;more
      shallowly than full recursion, with the freedom to bring in
      previously ignored files and subdirectories at a later
      time.</p>
      <p>For example, say we have a repository with a tree of files
      and directories with names of the members of a human family with
      pets.  (It&apos;s an odd example, to be sure, but bear with us.)  A
      regular <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> operation will give us a
      working copy of the whole tree:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom
A    mom/son

</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Now, let&apos;s check out the same tree again, but this time
      we&apos;ll ask Subversion to give us only the topmost directory
      with none of its children at all:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">

      </div>
      <p>Notice that we added to our original <span class="command"><strong>svn
      checkout</strong></span> command line a new <code class="option">--depth</code>
      option.  This option is present on many of Subversion&apos;s
      subcommands and is similar to the
      <code class="option">--non-recursive</code> (<code class="option">-N</code>) and
      <code class="option">--recursive</code> (<code class="option">-R</code>) options.  In
      fact, it combines, improves upon, supercedes, and ultimately
      obsoletes these two older options.  For starters, it expands the
      supported degrees of depth specification available to users,
      adding some previously unsupported (or inconsistently supported)
      depths.  Here are the depth values that you can request for a
      given Subversion operation:</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">--depth empty</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Include only the immediate target of the operation,
            not any of its file or directory children.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">--depth files</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file children.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">--depth immediates</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file or directory children.  The directory
            children will themselves be empty.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">--depth infinity</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Include the immediate target, its file and directory
            children, its children&apos;s children, and so on to full
            recursion.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p>Of course, merely combining two existing options into one
      hardly constitutes a new feature worthy of a whole section in
      our book.  Fortunately, there is more to this story.  This idea
      of depth extends not just to the operations you perform with
      your Subversion client, but also as a description of a working
      copy citizen&apos;s <em class="firstterm">ambient depth</em>, which is
      the depth persistently recorded by the working copy for that
      item.  Its key strength is this very persistence&#x2014;the fact
      that it is <em class="firstterm">sticky</em>.  The working copy
      remembers the depth you&apos;ve selected for each item in it until
      you later change that depth selection; by default, Subversion
      commands operate on the working copy citizens present,
      regardless of their selected depth settings.</p>

              <p>You can check the recorded ambient depth of a working copy

        info</strong></span> will display a line describing that depth
        value:</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Our previous examples demonstrated checkouts of infinite
      depth (the default for <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>) and
      empty depth.  Let&apos;s look now at examples of the other depth
      values:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-files --depth files

$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>As described, each of these depths is something more than
      only the target, but something less than full recursion.</p>
      <p>We&apos;ve used <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> as an example
      here, but you&apos;ll find the <code class="option">--depth</code> option
      present on many other Subversion commands, too.  In those other
      commands, depth specification is a way to limit the scope of an
      operation to some depth, much like the way the older
      <code class="option">--non-recursive</code> (<code class="option">-N</code>) and
      <code class="option">--recursive</code> (<code class="option">-R</code>) options
      behave.  This means that when operating on a working copy of
      some depth, while requesting an operation of a shallower depth,
      the operation is limited to that shallower depth.  In fact, we
      can make an even more general statement: given a working copy of
      any arbitrary&#x2014;even mixed&#x2014;ambient depth, and a
      Subversion command with some requested operational depth, the
      command will maintain the ambient depth of the working copy
      members while still limiting the scope of the operation to the
      requested (or default) operational depth.</p>
      <p>In addition to the <code class="option">--depth</code> option, the
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>
      subcommands also accept a second depth-related option:
      <code class="option">--set-depth</code>.  It is with this option that you
      can change the sticky depth of a working copy item.  Watch what
      happens as we take our empty-depth checkout and gradually
      telescope it deeper using <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update
      --set-depth <em class="replaceable"><code>NEW-DEPTH</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>TARGET</code></em></code></strong>:</p>

      <p>As we gradually increased our depth selection, the
      repository gave us more pieces of our tree.</p>
      <p>In our example, we operated only on the root of our working
      copy, changing its ambient depth value.  But we can
      independently change the ambient depth value of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> subdirectory inside the working copy,
      too.  Careful use of this ability allows us to flesh out only
      certain portions of the working copy tree, leaving other
      portions absent altogether (hence the <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">sparse</span>&#x201D;</span> bit
      of the feature&apos;s name).  Here&apos;s an example of how we might build
      out a portion of one branch of our family&apos;s tree, enable full
      recursion on another branch, and keep still other pieces pruned
      (absent from disk).</p>

      <p>Fortunately, having a complex collection of ambient depths
      in a single working copy doesn&apos;t complicate the way you interact
      with that working copy.  You can still make, revert, display,
      and commit local modifications in your working copy without
      providing any new options (including <code class="option">--depth</code> and
      <code class="option">--set-depth</code>) to the relevant subcommands.  Even
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> works as it does elsewhere when no
      specific depth is provided&#x2014;it updates the working copy
      targets that are present while honoring their sticky
      depths.</p>
      <p>You might at this point be wondering, <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">So what?  When
      would I use this?</span>&#x201D;</span>  One scenario where this feature
      finds utility is tied to a particular repository layout,
      specifically where you have many related or codependent
      projects or software modules living as siblings in a single
      repository location (<code class="filename">trunk/project1</code>,
      <code class="filename">trunk/project2</code>,
      <code class="filename">trunk/project3</code>, etc.).  In such
      scenarios, it might be the case that you personally care 
      about only a handful of those projects&#x2014;maybe some primary
      project and a few other modules on which it depends.  You can
      check out individual working copies of all of these things, but
      those working copies are disjoint and, as a result, it can be
      cumbersome to perform operations across several or all of them
      at the same time.  The alternative is to use the sparse
      directories feature, building out a single working copy that
      contains only the modules you care about.  You&apos;d start with an
      empty-depth checkout of the common parent directory of the
      projects, and then update with infinite depth only the items you
      wish to have, like we demonstrated in the previous example.
      Think of it like an opt-in system for working copy
      citizens.</p>
      <p>The original (Subversion 1.5) implementation of shallow
      checkouts was good, but didn&apos;t support de-telescoping of working
      copy items.  Subversion 1.6 remedied this problem.  For example,
      running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth empty</code></strong> in
      an infinite-depth working copy will discard everything but the
      topmost directory.<a href="#ftn.idm2945" class="footnote" id="idm2945"><sup class="footnote">[20]</sup></a>  Subversion
      1.6 also introduced another supported value for
      the <code class="option">--set-depth</code>
      option: <code class="literal">exclude</code>.  Using <code class="option">--set-depth
      exclude</code> with <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> will cause
      the update target to be removed from the working copy
      entirely&#x2014;a directory target won&apos;t even be left
      present-but-empty.  This is especially handy when there are more
      things that you&apos;d like to keep in a working copy than things
      you&apos;d like to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> keep.</p>
      <p>Consider a directory with hundreds of subdirectories, one of
      which you would like to omit from your working copy.  Using
      an <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">additive</span>&#x201D;</span> approach to sparse directories, you
      might check out the directory with an empty depth, then
      explicitly telescope (using <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth
      infinity</code></strong>) each and every subdirectory of the
      directory except the one you don&apos;t care about.</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/many-dirs --depth empty
&#x2026;
$ svn update --set-depth infinity many-dirs/wanted-dir-1
&#x2026;
$ svn update --set-depth infinity many-dirs/wanted-dir-2
&#x2026;
$ svn update --set-depth infinity many-dirs/wanted-dir-3
&#x2026;
### and so on, and so on, ...
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This could be quite tedious, especially since you don&apos;t even
      have stubs of these directories in your working copy to deal
      with.  Such a working copy would also have another
      characteristic that you might not expect or desire: if someone
      else creates any new subdirectories in this top-level directory,
      you won&apos;t receive those when you update your working
      copy.</p>
      <p>Beginning with Subversion 1.6, you can take a different
      approach.  First, check out the directory in full.  Then
      run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth exclude</code></strong> on the
      one subdirectory you don&apos;t care about.</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/many-dirs
&#x2026;
$ svn update --set-depth exclude many-dirs/unwanted-dir
D         many-dirs/unwanted-dir
$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This approach leaves your working copy with the same stuff
      as in the first approach, but any new subdirectories which
      appear in the top-level directory would also show up when you
      update your working copy.  The downside of this approach is that
      you have to actually check out that whole subdirectory that you
      don&apos;t even want just so you can tell Subversion that you don&apos;t
      want it.  This might not even be possible if that subdirectory
      is too large to fit on your disk (which might, after all, be the
      very reason you don&apos;t want it in your working copy).</p>

              <p>While the functionality for excluding an existing item
        from a working copy was hung off of the <span class="command"><strong>svn

        output from <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth
        exclude</code></strong> differs from that of a normal update
        operation.  This output betrays the fact that, under the hood,
        exclusion is a completely client-side operation, very much
        unlike a typical update.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>In such a situation, you might consider a compromise
      approach.  First, check out the top-level directory
      with <code class="option">--depth immediates</code>.  Then, exclude the
      directory you don&apos;t want using <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth
      exclude</code></strong>.  Finally, telescope all the items that
      remain to infinite depth, which should be fairly easy to do
      because they are all addressable in your shell.</p>

        <pre class="screen">

      <p>Once again, your working copy will have the same stuff as in
      the previous two scenarios.  But now, any time a new file or
      subdirectory is committed to the top-level directory, you&apos;ll
      receive it&#x2014;at an empty depth&#x2014;when you update your
      working copy.  You can now decide what to do with such newly
      appearing working copy items: expand them into infinite depth,
      or exclude them altogether.</p>
