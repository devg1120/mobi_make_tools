      <p>CVS marks conflicts with inline <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">conflict
      markers,</span>&#x201D;</span> and then prints a <code class="literal">C</code> during
      an update or merge operation.  Historically, this has caused
      problems, because CVS isn&apos;t doing enough.  Many users forget
      about (or don&apos;t see) the <code class="literal">C</code> after it whizzes
      by on their terminal.  They often forget that the conflict
      markers are even present, and then accidentally commit files
      containing those conflict markers.</p>
      <p>Subversion solves this problem in a pair of ways.  First,
      when a conflict occurs in a file, Subversion records the fact
      that the file is in a state of conflict, and won&apos;t allow you to
      commit changes to that file until you explicitly resolve the
      conflict.  Second, Subversion provides interactive conflict
      resolution, which allows you to resolve conflicts as they happen
      instead of having to go back and do so after the update or merge
      operation completes.  See  for more about conflict resolution in Subversion.</p>
