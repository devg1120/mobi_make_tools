      <p>Technical books always face a certain dilemma:  whether to
      cater to <em class="firstterm">top-down</em>
      or to <em class="firstterm">bottom-up</em> learners.  A top-down
      learner prefers to read or skim documentation, getting a large
      overview of how the system works; only then does she actually
      start using the software.  A bottom-up learner is a <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">learn by
      doing</span>&#x201D;</span> person&#x2014;someone who just wants to dive into the
      software and figure it out as she goes, referring to book
      sections when necessary.  Most books tend to be written for one
      type of person or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased
      toward top-down learners.  (And if you&apos;re actually reading this
      section, you&apos;re probably already a top-down learner yourself!)
      However, if you&apos;re a bottom-up person, don&apos;t despair.  While the
      book may be laid out as a broad survey of Subversion topics, the
      content of each section tends to be heavy with specific
      examples that you can try-by-doing.  For the impatient folks who
      just want to get going, you can jump right to
      .</p>
      <p>Regardless of your learning style, this book aims to be
      useful to people of widely different backgrounds&#x2014;from
      those with no previous experience in version control to
      experienced system administrators.  Depending on your own
      background, certain chapters may be more or less important to
      you.  The following can be considered a
      <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">recommended reading list</span>&#x201D;</span> for various types of
      readers:</p>

          <dd>
            <p>The assumption here is that you&apos;ve probably used
            version control before and are dying to get a
            Subversion server up and running ASAP.
             and
             will show you how to
            create your first repository and make it available over
            the network.  After that&apos;s done,
             and
             are the fastest routes to
            learning the Subversion client.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Your administrator has probably set up Subversion
            already, and you need to learn how to use the client.  If
            you&apos;ve never used a version control system, then
             is a vital introduction to the
            ideas behind version control.  
            is a guided tour of the Subversion client.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Whether you&apos;re a user or administrator, eventually
            your project will grow larger.  You&apos;re going to want to
            learn how to do more advanced things with Subversion, such
            as how to use Subversion&apos;s property support
            (), how to use branches and
            perform merges (), how to
            configure runtime options
            (), and other things.
            These chapters aren&apos;t critical at first, but be sure to
            read them once you&apos;re comfortable with the basics.</p>

            <p>Presumably, you&apos;re already familiar with Subversion,
            and now want to either extend it or build new software on
            top of its many APIs.   is
            just for you.</p>

      <p>The book ends with reference material&#x2014; is a reference guide for all Subversion
      commands, and the appendixes cover a number of useful topics.
      These are the chapters you&apos;re mostly likely to come back to
      after you&apos;ve finished the book.</p>
