      <p>Now that we&apos;ve covered the day-to-day tasks that you&apos;ll
      frequently use Subversion for, we&apos;ll review a few administrative
      tasks relating to your working copy.</p>
      <div class="sect2">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cleanup.disposal"></a>Disposing of a Working Copy</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion doesn&apos;t track either the state or the existence of
        working copies on the server, so there&apos;s no server overhead to
        keeping working copies around.  Likewise, there&apos;s no need to
        let the server know that you&apos;re going to delete a working
        copy.</p>
        <p>If you&apos;re likely to use a working copy again, there&apos;s
        nothing wrong with just leaving it on disk until you&apos;re ready
        to use it again, at which point all it takes is an
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring it up to date and ready
        for use.</p>
        <p>However, if you&apos;re definitely not going to use a working
        copy again, you can safely delete the entire thing using
        whatever directory removal capabilities your operating system
        offers.  We recommend that before you do so you
        run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn status</code></strong> and review any files
        listed in its output that are prefixed with a
        <code class="literal">?</code> to make certain that they&apos;re not of
        importance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cleanup.interruption"></a>Recovering from an Interruption</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>When Subversion modifies your working copy&#x2014;either
        your files or its own administrative state&#x2014;it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing the working copy,
        Subversion logs its intentions in a private <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">to-do
        list</span>&#x201D;</span>, of sorts.  Next, it performs those actions to
        effect the desired change, holding a lock on the relevant part
        of the working copy while it works.  This prevents other
        Subversion clients from accessing the working copy mid-change.
        Finally, Subversion releases its lock and cleans up its
        private to-do list.  Architecturally, this is similar to a
        journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation is
        interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the private to-do list remains on disk.  This allows
        Subversion to return to that list later to complete any
        unfinished operations and return your working copy to a
        consistent state.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what <span class="command"><strong>svn cleanup</strong></span> does:
        it searches your working copy and runs any leftover to-do
        items, removing working copy locks as it completes those
        operations.  If Subversion ever tells you that some part of
        your working copy is <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">locked,</span>&#x201D;</span> run <span class="command"><strong>svn
        cleanup</strong></span> to remedy the problem.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> command will inform you about administrative
        locks in the working copy, too, by displaying
        an <code class="literal">L</code> next to those locked paths:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status
  L     somedir
M       somedir/foo.c
$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M       somedir/foo.c
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Don&apos;t confuse these working copy administrative locks with
        the user-managed locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent version control;
        see the sidebar
         for
        clarification.</p>
