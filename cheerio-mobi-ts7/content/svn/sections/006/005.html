      <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command transforms an
      existing working copy to reflect a different branch.  While this
      command isn&apos;t strictly necessary for working with branches, it
      provides a nice shortcut.  In one of our earlier examples,
      after creating your private branch, you checked out a fresh
      working copy of the new repository directory.  Instead, you can
      simply ask Subversion to change your working copy of
      <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> to mirror the new branch
      location:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ cd calc
$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
$ svn switch ^/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
U    integer.c
U    button.c
U    Makefile
Updated to revision 341.
$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
</pre>
      </div>
      <p><span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">Switching</span>&#x201D;</span> a working copy that has no local
      modifications to a different branch results in the working copy
      looking just as it would if you&apos;d done a fresh checkout of the
      directory.  It&apos;s usually more efficient to
      use this command, because often branches differ by only a small
      degree.  The server sends only the minimal set of changes
      necessary to make your working copy reflect the branch
      directory.</p>
      <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command also takes a
      <code class="option">--revision</code> (<code class="option">-r</code>) option, so you
      need not always move your working copy to the
      <code class="literal">HEAD</code> of the branch.</p>
      <p>Of course, most projects are more complicated than our
      <code class="filename">calc</code> example, and contain multiple
      subdirectories.  Subversion users often follow a specific
      algorithm when using branches:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Copy the project&apos;s entire <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">trunk</span>&#x201D;</span> to a new
          branch directory.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Switch only <span class="emphasis"><em>part</em></span> of the trunk
          working copy to mirror the branch.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>In other words, if a user knows that the branch work needs
      to happen on only a specific subdirectory, she uses
      <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> to move only that subdirectory to
      the branch.  (Or sometimes users will switch just a single
      working file to the branch!)  That way, the user can continue to
      receive normal <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">trunk</span>&#x201D;</span> updates to most of her
      working copy, but the switched portions will remain immune
      (unless someone commits a change to her branch).  This feature
      adds a whole new dimension to the concept of a <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">mixed
      working copy</span>&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;not only can working copies contain a
      mixture of working revisions, but they can also contain a
      mixture of repository locations as well.</p>

              <p>Typically switched subdirectories share common ancestry with

        <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> can switch a subdirectory to mirror
        a repository location which it shares no common ancestry with.
        To do this you need to use the
        <code class="option">--ignore-ancestry</code> option.

      <p>If your working copy contains a number of switched subtrees
      from different repository locations, it continues to function as
      normal.  When you update, you&apos;ll receive patches to each subtree
      as appropriate.  When you commit, your local changes are still
      applied as a single, atomic change to the repository.</p>
      <p>Note that while it&apos;s okay for your working copy to reflect a
      mixture of repository locations, these locations must all be
      within the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> repository.  Subversion
      repositories aren&apos;t yet able to communicate with one another;
      that feature is planned for the
      future.<a href="#ftn.idm4550" class="footnote" id="idm4550"><sup class="footnote">[34]</sup></a></p>

          </div>

        <p>Have you noticed that the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        switch</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> looks the
        same?  The switch command is actually a superset of the update
        command.</p>
        <p>When you run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, you&apos;re asking
        the repository to compare two trees.  The repository does so,
        and then sends a description of the differences back to the
        client.  The only difference between <span class="command"><strong>svn
        switch</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> is that the
        latter command always compares two identical repository
        paths.</p>
        <p>That is, if your working copy is a mirror of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> will automatically compare your working copy
        of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> to
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> in the
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.  If you&apos;re switching your
        working copy to a branch, <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>
        will compare your working copy of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> to some
        <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> branch directory in the
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.</p>
        <p>In other words, an update moves your working copy through
        time.  A switch moves your working copy through time
        <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> space.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Because <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> is essentially a
      variant of <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, it shares the same
      behaviors; any local modifications in your working copy are
      preserved when new data arrives from the repository.</p>

              <p>Have you ever found yourself making some complex edits (in
        your <code class="filename">/trunk</code> working copy) and suddenly

        branch?</span>&#x201D;</span> There is a great two step technique to do
        this:</p>

              <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command, like

        invocation will send your changes there.</p>
