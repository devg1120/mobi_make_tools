      <p>In the most general sense, Subversion handles binary files
      more gracefully than CVS does.  Because CVS uses RCS, it can
      only store successive full copies of a changing binary file.
      Subversion, however, expresses differences between files using a
      binary differencing algorithm, regardless of whether they
      contain textual or binary data.  That means all files are
      stored differentially (compressed) in the repository.</p>
      <p>CVS users have to mark binary files with
      <code class="option">-kb</code> flags to prevent data from being
      garbled (due to keyword expansion and line-ending translations).
      They sometimes forget to do this.</p>
      <p>Subversion takes the more paranoid route.  First, it never
      performs any kind of keyword or line-ending translation unless
      you explicitly ask it to do so (see
       and
       for more
      details).  By default, Subversion treats all file data as
      literal byte strings, and files are always stored in the
      repository in an untranslated state.</p>
      <p>Second, Subversion maintains an internal notion of whether a
      file is <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">text</span>&#x201D;</span> or <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">binary</span>&#x201D;</span> data, but
      this notion is <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> extant in the working
      copy.  During an <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, Subversion will
      perform contextual merges on locally modified text files, but
      will not attempt to do so for binary files.</p>
      <p>To determine whether a contextual merge is possible,
      Subversion examines the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
      property.  If the file has no <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
      property, or has a MIME type that is textual (e.g.,
      <code class="literal">text/*</code>),
      Subversion assumes it is text.  Otherwise, Subversion assumes
      the file is binary.  Subversion also helps users by running a
      binary-detection algorithm in the <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span>
      and <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> commands.  These commands will
      make a good guess and then (possibly) set a binary
      <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on the file being
      added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, the user can always remove
      or hand-edit the property.)</p>
