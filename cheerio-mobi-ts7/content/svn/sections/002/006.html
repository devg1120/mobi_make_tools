      <p>This book would not be possible (nor very useful) if
      Subversion did not exist.  For that, the authors would like to
      thank Brian Behlendorf and CollabNet for the vision to fund such
      a risky and ambitious new open source project; Jim Blandy for
      the original Subversion name and design&#x2014;we love you, Jim;
      and Karl Fogel for being such a good friend and a great
      community leader, in that order.<a href="#ftn.idm405" class="footnote" id="idm405"><sup class="footnote">[4]</sup></a></p>
      <p>Thanks to O&apos;Reilly and the team of professional editors who
      have helped us polish this text at various stages of its
      evolution: Chuck Toporek, Linda Mui, Tatiana Apandi, Mary Brady,
      and Mary Treseler.  Your patience and support has been
      tremendous.</p>
      <p>Finally, we thank the countless people who contributed to
      this book with informal reviews, suggestions, and patches.  An
      exhaustive listing of those folks&apos; names would be impractical to
      print and maintain here, but may their names live on forever in
      this book&apos;s version control history!</p>
