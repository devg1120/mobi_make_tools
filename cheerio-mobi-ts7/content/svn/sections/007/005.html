      <p>Subversion repository data is wholly contained within the
      repository directory.  As such, you can move a Subversion
      repository to some other location on disk, rename a repository,
      copy a repository, or delete a repository altogether using the
      tools provided by your operating system for manipulating
      directories&#x2014;<span class="command"><strong>mv</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>cp
      -a</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>rm -r</strong></span> on Unix platforms;
      <span class="command"><strong>copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>move</strong></span>, and
      <span class="command"><strong>rmdir /s /q</strong></span> on Windows; vast numbers of mouse
      and menu gyrations in various graphical file explorer
      applications, and so on.</p>
      <p>Of course, there&apos;s often still more to be done when trying
      to cleanly affect changes such as this.  For example, you might
      need to update your Subversion server configuration to point to
      the new location of a relocated repository or to remove
      configuration bits for a now-deleted repository.  If you have
      automated processes that publish information from or about your
      repositories, they may need to be updated.  Hook scripts might
      need to be reconfigured.  Users may need to be notified.  The list
      can go on indefinitely, or at least to the extent that you&apos;ve
      built processes and procedures around your Subversion
      repository.</p>
      <p>In the case of a copied repository, you should also consider
      the fact that Subversion uses repository UUIDs to distinguish
      repositories.  If you copy a Subversion repository using a
      typical shell recursive copy command, you&apos;ll wind up with two
      repositories that are identical in every way&#x2014;including
      their UUIDs.  In some circumstances, this might be desirable.
      But in the instances where it is not, you&apos;ll need to generate a
      new UUID for one of these identical repositories.  See
       for more about
      managing repository UUIDs.</p>
