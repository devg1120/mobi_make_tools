<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2891992">The Elements of Operating-System Style</a></h2></div></div><p>Before we can start discussing specific operating systems, we&apos;ll
need an organizing framework for the ways that operating-system
design can affect programming style for good or ill.</p><p>Overall, the design and programming styles associated with
different operating systems seem to derive from three different
sources: (a) the intentions of the operating-system designers, (b)
uniformities forced on designs by costs and limitations in the
programming environment, and (c) random cultural drift, early
practices becoming traditional simply because they were there
first.</p><p>Even if we take it as given that there is some random cultural
drift in every operating-system community, considering the intentions
of the designers and the costs and limitations of the results does
reveal some interesting patterns that can help us understand the Unix
style better by contrast.  We can make the patterns explicit by
analyzing some of the most important ways that operating systems
differ.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2892028">What Is the Operating System&apos;s Unifying Idea?</a></h3></div></div><p>Unix has a couple of unifying ideas or metaphors that shape its
APIs and the development style that proceeds from them.  The most
important of these are probably the &#x201C;everything is a
file&#x201D; model and the pipe metaphor</p><p>Accordingly, the most basic question to ask in contrasting Unix
with another operating system is: Does it have unifying ideas that
shape its development, and if so how do they differ from
Unix&apos;s?</p><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, have no unifying idea at all,
just an incoherent pile of ad-hoc features.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2892085">Multitasking Capability</a></h3></div></div><p>One of the most basic ways operating systems can differ is in
the extent to which they can support multiple concurrent processes.  At
the lowest end (such as DOS or CP/M) the operating system is basically
a sequential program loader with no capacity to multitask at all.
Operating systems of this kind are no longer competitive on
general-purpose computers.</p><p>At the next level up, an operating system may have
<i>cooperative multitasking</i>.  Such systems can
support multiple processes, but a process has to voluntarily give up
its hold on the processor before the next one can run (thus, simple
programming errors can readily freeze the machine).  This style of
operating system was a transient adaptation to hardware that was
powerful enough for concurrency but lacked either a periodic clock
interrupt<sup>[<a id="id2892115" href="ch03s01.html#ftn.id2892115">21</a>]</sup> or a memory-management unit or both; it,
too, is obsolete and no longer competitive.</p><p>Unix has <i>preemptive multitasking</i>, in
which timeslices are allocated by a scheduler which routinely
interrupts or pre-empts the running process in order to hand control
to the next one.  Almost all modern operating systems support
preemption.</p><p>Note that &#x201C;multitasking&#x201D; is not the same as
&#x201C;multiuser&#x201D;.  An operating system can be multitasking
but single-user, in which case the facility is used to support a
single console and multiple background processes.  True multiuser
support requires multiple user privilege domains, a feature we&apos;ll
cover in the discussion of internal boundaries a bit further on.</p><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, don&apos;t support multitasking at
all &#x2014; or, support multitasking but cripple it by surrounding
process management with a lot of restrictions, limitations, and
special cases that mean it&apos;s quite difficult to get any actual use out
of multitasking.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2892171">Cooperating Processes</a></h3></div></div><p>In the Unix experience, inexpensive process-spawning and easy
inter-process communication (IPC) makes a whole ecology of small
tools, pipes</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>The pipe was technically trivial, but profound in its effect.
However, it would not have been trivial without the fundamental
unifying notion of the process as an autonomous unit of computation,
with process control being programmable.  As in Multics, a shell was
just another process; process control did not come from God inscribed
in JCL.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td></tr></table></div><p>If an operating system makes spawning new processes expensive
and/or process control is difficult and inflexible, you&apos;ll usually see
all of the following consequences:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Monster monoliths become a more natural way of programming.</p></li><li><p>Lots of policy has to be expressed within those monoliths. This
encourages C++</p></li><li><p>When processes can&apos;t avoid a need to communicate, they do so
through mechanisms that are either clumsy, inefficient, and insecure
(such as temporary files) or by knowing far too much about each others&apos;
implementations.</p></li><li><p>Multithreading is extensively used for tasks that Unix would
handle with multiple communicating lightweight processes.</p></li><li><p>Learning and using asynchronous I/O is a must.</p></li></ul></div><p>These are examples of common stylistic traits (even in
applications programming) being driven by a limitation in the OS
environment.</p><p>A subtle but important property of pipes and the other classic
Unix IPC methods is that they require communication between programs
to be held down to a level of simplicity that encourages separation of
function.  Conversely, the result of having no equivalent of the pipe
is that programs can only be designed to cooperate by building in full
knowledge of each others&apos; internals.</p><p>In operating systems without flexible IPC and a strong tradition
of using it, programs communicate by sharing elaborate data
structures.  Because the communication problem has to be solved anew
for all programs every time another is added to the set, the
complexity of this solution rises as the square of the number of
cooperating programs.  Worse than that, any change in one of the
exposed data structures can induce subtle bugs in an arbitrarily 
large number of other programs.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Word and Excel and PowerPoint and other Microsoft programs have

of.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

expensive, make process control difficult and inflexible, and
leave IPC as an unsupported or half-supported afterthought.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2888136">Internal Boundaries</a></h3></div></div><p>Unix has wired into it an assumption that the programmer knows
best.  It doesn&apos;t stop you or request confirmation when you do
dangerous things with your own data, like issuing <b>rm -rf
*</b>.  On the other hand, Unix is rather careful about not
letting you step on other people&apos;s data.  In fact, Unix encourages you
to have multiple accounts, each with its own attached and possibly
differing privileges, to help you protect yourself from misbehaving
programs.<sup>[<a id="id2888159" href="ch03s01.html#ftn.id2888159">22</a>]</sup>  System
programs often have their own pseudo-user accounts to confer access to
special system files without requiring unlimited
(or <i>superuser</i>) access.</p><p>Unix has at least three levels of internal boundaries that guard
against malicious users or buggy programs. One is memory management;
Unix uses its hardware&apos;s memory management unit (MMU) to ensure that
separate processes are prevented from intruding on the others&apos;
memory-address spaces.  A second is the presence of true privilege
groups for multiple users &#x2014; an ordinary (nonroot) user&apos;s
processes cannot alter or read another user&apos;s files without
permission.  A third is the confinement of security-critical functions
to the smallest possible pieces of trusted code.  Under Unix, even the
shell (the system command interpreter) is not a privileged
program. </p><p>The strength of an operating system&apos;s internal boundaries
is not merely an abstract issue of design: It has important
practical consequences for the security of the system. </p><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, discard or bypass memory
management so that a runaway process can crash, subvert, or corrupt
any running program.  Have weak or nonexistent privilege groups, so
users can readily alter each others&apos; files and the system&apos;s critical
data (e.g., a macro virus, having seized control of your word
processor, can format your hard drive).  And trust large volumes of
code, like the entire shell and GUI, so that any bug or successful
attack on that code becomes a threat to the entire system.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2888217">File Attributes and Record Structures</a></h3></div></div><p>Unix files have neither record structure nor attributes.  In
some operating systems, files have an associated record structure; the
operating system (or its service libraries) knows about files with a 
fixed record length, or about text line termination and whether CR/LF
is to be read as a single logical character.</p><p>In other operating systems, files and directories can have
name/attribute pairs associated with them &#x2014; out-of-band data
used (for example) to associate a document file with an application
that understands it.  (The classic Unix way to handle these associations is
to have applications recognize &#x2018;magic numbers&#x2019;, or other
type data within the file itself.)</p><p>OS-level record structures are generally an optimization
hack</p><p>File attributes can be useful, but (as we will see in <a href="futurechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;20.&#xFFFD;Futures">Chapter&#xFFFD;20</a>) can raise some awkward semantic issues in a
world of byte-stream-oriented tools and
pipes</p><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, have a cumbersome set of record 
structures that make it a hit-or-miss proposition whether any given
tool will be able to even read a file as the writer intended it.  Add
file attributes and have the system depend on them heavily, so that 
the semantics of a file will not be determinable by looking at the
data within it.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2888298">Binary File Formats</a></h3></div></div><p>If your operating system uses binary formats for critical data
(such as user-account records) it is likely that no tradition of
readable textual formats for applications will develop.  We explain in
more detail why this is a problem in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a>.  For now it&apos;s sufficient to note the
following consequences:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Even if a command-line interface, scripting, and
pipes</p></li><li><p>Data files will be accessible only through dedicated tools.
Developers will think of the tools rather than the data files as central.
Thus, different versions of file formats will tend to be incompatible.</p></li></ul></div><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, make all file formats binary 
and opaque, and require heavyweight tools to read and edit them.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2888363">Preferred User Interface Style</a></h3></div></div><p>In <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a> we
will develop in some detail the consequences of the differences
between <i>command-line interfaces</i> (CLIs) and
<i>graphical user interfaces</i> (GUIs).  Which kind
an operating system&apos;s designers choose as its normal mode of
presentation will affect many aspects of the design, from process
scheduling and memory management on up to the <i>application
programming interfaces</i> (APIs) presented for applications
to use.</p><p>It has been enough years since the first Macintosh that very few
people need to be convinced that weak GUI facilities in an operating
system are a problem.  The Unix lesson is the opposite: that weak
CLI facilities are a less obvious but equally severe deficit.</p><p>If the CLI facilities of an operating system are weak or
nonexistent, you&apos;ll also see the following consequences:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Programs will not be designed to cooperate with each other in
unexpected ways &#x2014; because they <span class="emphasis"><em>can&apos;t</em></span> be.  Outputs
aren&apos;t usable as inputs.</p></li><li><p>Remote system administration will be sparsely supported, more
difficult to use, and more network-intensive.<sup>[<a id="id2888440" href="ch03s01.html#ftn.id2888440">23</a>]</sup></p></li><li><p>Even simple noninteractive programs will incur the overhead 
of a GUI or elaborate scripting interface.</p></li><li><p>Servers, daemons, and background processes will probably be
impossible or at least rather difficult, to program in any graceful
way.</p></li></ul></div><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, have no CLI and no 
capability to script programs &#x2014; or, important facilities that
the CLI cannot drive.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2888484">Intended Audience</a></h3></div></div><p>The design of operating systems varies in response to the 
expected audience for the system.  Some operating systems are
intended for back rooms, some for desktops.  Some are designed
for technical users, others for end users.  Some are intended to
work standalone in real-time control applications, others for an 
environment of timesharing and pervasive networking.</p><p>One important distinction is client
vs. server. &#x2018;Client&#x2019; translates as: being lightweight,
suppporting only a single user, able to run on small machines,
designed to be switched on when needed and off when the user is done,
lacking pre-emptive multitasking, optimized for low latency, and
putting a lot of its resources into fancy user interfaces.
&#x2018;Server&#x2019; translates as: being heavyweight, capable of
running continuously, optimized for throughput, fully pre-emptively
multitasking to handle multiple sessions.  In origin all operating
systems were server operating systems; the concept of a client
operating system only emerged in the late 1970s with inexpensive but
underpowered PC hardware.  Client operating systems are more focused
on a visually attractive user experience than on 24/7 uptime.</p><p>All these variables have an effect on development style. One of
the most obvious is the level of interface complexity the target
audience will tolerate, and how it tends to weight perceived
complexity against other variables like cost and capability. Unix is
often said to have been written by programmers for programmers &#x2014;
an audience that is notoriously tolerant of interface
complexity.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>This is a consequence rather than a goal.  I abhor a system designed

thinks it knows what you&apos;re doing better than you do.  And then adds
injury to insult by getting it wrong.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2888581">Entry Barriers to Development</a></h3></div></div><p>Another important dimension along which operating systems differ
is the height of the barrier that separates mere users from becoming
developers.  There are two important cost drivers here.  One is the
monetary cost of development tools, the other is the time cost of
gaining proficiency as a developer.  Some development cultures evolve
social barriers to entry, but these are usually an effect of the
underlying technology costs, not a primary cause.</p><p>Expensive development tools and complex, opaque APIs produce
small and elitist programming cultures.  In those cultures,
programming projects are large, serious endeavors &#x2014; they have to
be in order to offer a payoff that justifies the cost of both hard and
soft (human) capital invested.  Large, serious projects tend to
produce large, serious programs (and, far too often, large expensive
failures).</p><p>Inexpensive tools and simple interfaces support casual
programming, hobbyist cultures, and exploration.  Programming projects
can be small (often, formal project structure is plain unnecessary),
and failure is not a catastrophe.  This changes the style in which
people develop code; among other things, they show less tendency to
over-commit to failed approaches.</p><p>Casual programming tends to produce lots of small programs and a
self-reinforcing, expanding community of knowledge.  In a world of
cheap hardware, the presence or absence of such a community is an
increasingly important factor in whether an operating system is
long-term viable at all.</p><p>Unix pioneered casual programming. One of the things Unix was
first at doing was shipping with a compiler and scripting tools as
part of the default installation available to all users, supporting a
hobbyist software-development culture that spanned multiple
installations.  Many people who write code under Unix do not think of
it as writing code &#x2014; they think of it as writing scripts to
automate common tasks, or as customizing their environment.</p><p>To design the perfect anti-Unix, make casual programming
impossible.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2892049" href="ch03s01.html#id2892049">20</a>] </sup>For

output of one program to the input of another.  We&apos;ll explore the ways

is useful as a sort of heartbeat for a timesharing system; each time
it fires, it tells the system that it may be time to switch to another
task, defining the size of the unit timeslice.  In 2003 Unixes
usually set the heartbeat to either 60 or 100 times a
second.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2888159" href="ch03s01.html#id2888159">22</a>] </sup>The modern buzzword for this is
