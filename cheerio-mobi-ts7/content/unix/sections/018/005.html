<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id3000262">Programming for Portability</a></h2></div></div><p>Software portability is usually thought of in quasi-spatial
terms: can this code be moved sideways to existing hardware and
software platforms other than the one it was built for?  But Unix
experience over decades tells us that durability down through time is
just as important, if not more so.  If we could predict the future of
software in detail it would probably be the present &#x2014;
nevertheless, in programming for portability we should try to think
about making choices that will base the software on the features of
its environment that are likeliest to persist, and avoid technologies
that seem likely to face end-of-life in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Under Unix, two decades of attention to the issues of
specifying portable APIs has largely solved that problem.  Facilities
described in the Single Unix Specification are likely to be present
on all modern Unix platforms today and rather unlikely to go 
unsupported in the future.</p><p>But not all platform dependencies have to do with the system
or library APIs.  Your implementation language can matter; file-system
layout and configuration differences between the source and target
system can be a problem as well.  But Unix practice has evolved ways 
to cope.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3000303">Portability and Choice of Language</a></h3></div></div><p>The first issue in programming for portability is your choice of
implementation language.  All the major languages we surveyed in <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;14.&#xFFFD;Languages">Chapter&#xFFFD;14</a> are highly portable
in the sense that compatible implementations are available across all
modern Unixes; for most, implementations under Windows and MacOS are
available as well.  Portability problems tend to arise not in the core
languages but in support libraries and degree of integration with the
local environment (especially IPC and concurrent-process management,
including the infrastructure for GUIs).</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="c_portability">C Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="cc_portability">C++ Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="shell_portability">Shell Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="perl_portability">Perl Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="python_portability">Python Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="tcl_portability">Tcl Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="java_portability">Java Portability</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="emacs_lisp_portability">Emacs Lisp Portability</a></h4></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3000882">Avoiding System Dependencies</a></h3></div></div><p>Once your language and support libraries are chosen, the next
portability issue is usually the location of key system files and
directories: mail spools, logfile directories and the like.
The archetype of this sort of problem is whether the mail spool
directory is <tt>/var/spool/mail</tt> or
<tt>/var/mail</tt>.</p><p>Often, you can avoid this sort of dependency by stepping back
and reframing the problem.  Why are you opening a file in the mail
spool directory, anyway?  If you&apos;re writing to it, wouldn&apos;t it be
better to simply invoke the local mail transport agent to do it for
you so the file-locking gets done right?  If you&apos;re reading from it, 
might it be better to query it through a POP3 or IMAP server?</p><p>The same sort of question applies elsewhere.  If you find
yourself opening logfiles manually, shouldn&apos;t you be using
syslog(3)
instead?  Function-call interfaces through the C library are better
standardized than system file locations.  Use that fact!</p><p>If you must have system file locations in your code, your best
alternative depends on whether you will be distributing in source code
or binary form.  If you are distributing in source, the
<i>autoconf</i> tools we discuss in the next
section will help you.  If you&apos;re distributing in binary, then it&apos;s
good practice to have your program poke around at runtime and see if
it can automatically adapt itself to local conditions &#x2014; say, by
actually checking for the existence of <tt>/var/mail</tt> and <tt>/var/spool/mail</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3000984">Tools for Portability</a></h3></div></div><p>You can often use the open-source GNU
autoconf(1)
we surveyed in <a href="toolschapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;15.&#xFFFD;Tools">Chapter&#xFFFD;15</a> to
handle portability issues, do system-configuration probes, and tailor
your makefiles.  People building from sources today expect to be able
to type <b>configure; make; make install</b> and get a
clean build.  There is a good <a href="http://seul.org/docs/autotut/" target="_top">tutorial on these
tools</a>. Even if you&apos;re distributing in binary, the
autoconf(1)
tools can help automate away the problem of conditionalizing your code
for different platforms.</p><p>Other tools that address this problem; two of the better known
are the
Imake(1)
tool associated with the X windowing system and the <i>Configure</i> tool built by Larry Wall (later
the inventor of Perl</p></div></div>
