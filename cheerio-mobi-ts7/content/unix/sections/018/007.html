implementations are the most effective method known for both
promulgating a standard and for pressuring proprietary vendors into
conforming.  If you are a developer, open-source implementations of a
published standard can both tremendously reduce your coding workload
and allow your product to benefit (in ways both expected and
unexpected) from the labor of others.</p><p>Let&apos;s suppose, for example, you are designing image-capture
software for a digital camera.  Why write your own format for saving
image bits or buy proprietary code when (as we noted in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a>) there is a well-tested, full-featured
library for writing PNGs in open source?</p><p>The (re)invention of open source has had a significant impact on
the standards process as well.  Though it is not formally a
requirement, the IETF</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>The flip side of this is that often the best way to

portability of your code is to not rely on proprietary technology.
You never know when the closed-source library or tool or code
generator or network protocol you are depending on will be
end-of-lifed, or when the interface will be changed in some
backwards-incompatible way that breaks your project.  With open-source
code, you have a path forward even if the leading-edge version changes
in a way that breaks your project; because you have access to source
code, you can forward-port it to new platforms if you need to.</p><p>Until the late 1990s this advice would have been 
impractical.  The few alternatives to relying on proprietary operating
systems and development tools were noble experiments, academic
proofs-of-concept, or toys.  But the Internet changed everything; in
mid-2003 Linux</p></div>
