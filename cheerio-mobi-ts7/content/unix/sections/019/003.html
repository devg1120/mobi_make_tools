This is running text.
.\&quot; Comments begin with a backslash and double quote.
.ft B
This text will be in bold font.
.ft R
This text will be back in the default (Roman) font.
These lines, going back to &quot;This is running text&quot;, will 
be formatted as a filled paragraph.
.bp
The bp request forces a new page and a paragraph break.
This line will be part of the second filled paragraph.
.sp 3
The .sp request emits the number of blank lines given as argument
.nf
The nf request switches off paragraph filling.
Until the fi request switches it back on
whitespace and layout will be preserved.
One word in this line will be in \fBbold\fR font.
.fi
Paragraph filling is back on.

has many other requests, but you are unlikely to see most of them
directly.  Very few documents are written in bare
<i>troff</i>.  It supports a macro facility, and
half a dozen macro packages are in more or less general use.  Of
these, the overwhelmingly most common is the
man(7)
macro package used to write Unix manual pages.  See <a href="ch18s03.html#man_example" title="Example&#xFFFD;18.2.&#xFFFD;man markup example.">Example&#xFFFD;18.2</a> for a sample.</p><div class="example"><a id="man_example"><p class="title"><b>Example&#xFFFD;18.2.&#xFFFD;<i>man</i> markup example.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">
.SH SAMPLE SECTION
The SH macro starts a section, boldfacing the section title.  
.P
The P request starts a new paragraph.  The I request sets its 
argument in
.I italics.
.IP *
This starts an indented paragraph with an asterisk label.
More text for the first bulleted paragraph.
.TP
This first line will become a paragraph label
This will be the first line in the paragraph, further indented
relative to the label.
The blank line just above this is treated almost exactly like a
paragraph break (actually, like the troff-level request .sp 1).

This is subsection text.  
</pre></a></div><p>Two of the other half-dozen historical
<i>troff</i> macro libraries, 
ms(7)
and
mm(7)
are still in use.  BSD Unix has its own elaborate
extended macro set,
mdoc(7).
All these are designed for writing technical manuals and long-form
documentation.  They are similar in style but more elaborate than man
macros, and oriented toward producing typeset output.</p><p>A minor variant of
troff(1)
called
nroff(1)
produces output for devices that can only support constant-width
fonts, like line printers and character-cell terminals.  When you view
a Unix manual page within a terminal window, it is nroff that has
rendered it for you.</p><p>The Documenter&apos;s Workbench tools do the technical-documentation
jobs they were designed for quite well, which is why they have
remained in continuous use for more than thirty years while computers
increased a thousandfold in capacity. They produce typeset text of
reasonable quality on imaging printers, and can throw a tolerable
approximation of a formatted manual page on your screen.</p><p>They fall down badly in a couple of areas, however.  Their stock
selection of available fonts is limited.  They don&apos;t handle images
well. It&apos;s hard to get precise control of the positioning of text or
images or diagrams within a page.  Support for multilingual documents
is nonexistent.  There are numerous other problems, some chronic but
minor and some absolute showstoppers for specific uses.  But the most
serious problem is that because so much of the markup is presentation
level, it&apos;s difficult to make good Web pages out of unmodified
<i>troff</i> sources.</p><p>Nevertheless, at time of writing man pages remain the single 
most important form of Unix documentation.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3001898"><i>TeX</i></a></h3></div></div><p><i>TeX</i> (pronounced
<span class="phonetic">/teH/</span> with a rough h as though you are
gargling) is a very capable typesetting program that, like the
Emacs editor, originated outside the Unix
culture but is now naturalized in it.  It was created by noted
computer scientist Donald Knuth</p><p><i>TeX</i>, like
troff(1),
is a markup-centered system.  <i>TeX</i>&apos;s request
language is rather more powerful than
<i>troff</i>&apos;s; among other things, it is better
at handling images, page-positioning content precisely, and
internationalization.  <i>TeX</i> is particularly
good at mathematical typesetting, and unsurpassed at basic typesetting
tasks like kerning, line filling, and hyphenating.
<i>TeX</i> has become the standard submission
format for most mathematical journals.  It is actually now maintained
as open source by a working group of the the American Mathematical
Society.  It is also commonly used for scientific papers.</p><p>As with
troff(1),
human beings usually do not write large volumes of raw
<i>TeX</i> macros by hand; they use macro packages
and various auxiliary programs instead.  One particular macro package,
<i>LaTeX</i>, is almost universal, and most people who say they&apos;re composing
in <i>TeX</i> almost always actually mean they&apos;re
writing <i>LaTeX</i>.  Like <i>troff</i>&apos;s macro
packages, a lot of its requests are semi-structural.</p><p>One important use of <i>TeX</i> that is
normally hidden from the user is that other document-processing tools
often generate <i>LaTeX</i> to be turned into PostScript, rather than
attempting the much more difficult job of generating PostScript
themselves.  The
xmlto(1)
front end that we discussed as a shell-programming case study in <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;14.&#xFFFD;Languages">Chapter&#xFFFD;14</a> uses this tactic; so does the XML-DocBook
toolchain we&apos;ll examine later in this chapter.</p><p><i>TeX</i> has a wider application range
than
troff(1)
and is in most ways a better design.  It has the same fundamental
problems as <i>troff</i> in an increasingly
Web-centric world; its markup has strong ties to the presentation
level, and automatically generating good Web pages from
<i>TeX</i> sources is difficult and
fault-prone.</p><p><i>TeX</i> is never used for Unix system
documentation and only rarely used for application documentation;
for those purposes, <i>troff</i> is sufficient.
But some software packages that originated in academia outside the
Unix community have imported the use of <i>TeX</i>
as a documentation master format; the Python
language</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3002206">Texinfo</a></h3></div></div><p>Texinfo is a documentation markup invented by the Free Software
Foundation and used mainly for GNU</p><p>Texinfo was the first markup system specifically designed to
support both typeset output on paper and hypertext output for
browsing.  The hypertext format was not, however, HTML; it was a more
primitive variety called &#x2018;info&#x2019;, originally designed to be
browsed from within Emacs. On the print
side, Texinfo turns into <i>TeX</i> macros and can
go from there to PostScript.</p><p>The Texinfo tools can now generate HTML.  But they don&apos;t do a
very good or complete job, and because a lot of Texinfo&apos;s markup
is at presentation level it is doubtful that they ever will.  As of
mid-2003, the Free Software Foundation is working on heuristic Texinfo 
to DocBook translation.  Texinfo will probably remain a live format
for some time.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3002268">POD</a></h3></div></div><p>Plain Old Documentation is the markup system used by the
maintainers of Perl</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3002291">HTML</a></h3></div></div><p>Since the World Wide Web entered the mainstream in the early
1990s, a small but increasing percentage of Unix projects have been
writing their documentation directly in HTML.  The problem with this
approach is that it is difficult to generate high-quality typeset
output from HTML.  There are particular problems with indexing as
well; the information needed to generate indexes is not present in
HTML.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3002310">DocBook</a></h3></div></div><p>DocBook is an SGML and XML document type definition designed for
large, complex technical documents.  It is alone among the markup
formats used in the Unix community in being purely structural.  The
xmlto(1)
tool discussed in <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;14.&#xFFFD;Languages">Chapter&#xFFFD;14</a> supports rendering to HTML, XHTML,
PostScript, PDF</p><p>Several major open-source projects (including the Linux
Documentation Project, FreeBSD,
Apache</p><p>DocBook is a large topic. We&apos;ll return to it after summing up
the problems with the current state of Unix documentation.</p></div></div>
