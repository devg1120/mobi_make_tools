<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id3007808">Best Practices for Working with Open-Source Developers</a></h2></div></div><p>Much of what constitutes best practice in the open-source
community is a natural adaptation to distributed development; you&apos;ll
read a lot in the rest of this chapter about behaviors that maintain
good communication with other developers.  Where Unix conventions are
arbitrary (such as the standard names of files that convey
metainformation about a source distribution) they often trace back
either to Usenet</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="patching">Good Patching Practice</a></h3></div></div><p>Most people become involved in open-source software by writing patches
for other people&apos;s software before releasing projects of their own.
Suppose you&apos;ve written a set of source-code changes for someone else&apos;s
baseline code. Now put yourself in that person&apos;s shoes. How is he
to judge whether to include the patch?</p><p>It is very difficult to judge the quality of code, so
developers tend to evaluate patches by the quality of the submission.
They look for clues in the submitter&apos;s style and communications
behavior instead &#x2014; indications that the person has been in their
shoes and understands what it&apos;s like to have to evaluate and merge an
incoming patch.</p><p>This is actually a rather reliable proxy for code quality.  In
many years of dealing with patches from many hundreds of strangers,
I have only seldom seen a patch that was thoughtfully
presented and respectful of my time but technically bogus.  On the
other hand, experience teaches that patches which look careless or
are packaged in a lazy and inconsiderate way are very likely to
actually <span class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> bogus.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to get your patch accepted:</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3007894">Do send patches, don&apos;t send whole archives or files.</a></h4></div></div><p>If your change includes a new file that doesn&apos;t exist in the code,
then of course you have to send the whole file.  But if you&apos;re modifying
an already-existing file, don&apos;t send the whole file.  Send a diff instead;
specifically, send the output of the 
diff(1)
command run to compare the baseline distributed version against your
modified version.</p><p>The
diff(1)
command and its dual,
patch(1),
are the most basic tools of open-source development.  Diffs are better
than whole files because the developer you&apos;re sending a patch to may
have changed the baseline version since you got your copy.  By sending
him a diff you save him the effort of separating your changes from
his; you show respect for his time.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3007953">Send patches against the current version of the code.</a></h4></div></div><p>It is both counterproductive and rude to send a maintainer
patches against the code as it existed several releases ago, and expect
him to do all the work of determining which changes duplicate things he
has since done, versus which things are actually novel in your patch.</p><p>As a patch submitter, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> responsibility
to track the state of the source and send the maintainer a minimal patch
that expresses what you want done to the main-line codebase. That means
sending a patch against the current version.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3007988">Don&apos;t include patches for generated files.</a></h4></div></div><p>Before you send your patch, walk through it and delete any patch
bands for files in it that are going to be automatically regenerated
once the maintainer applies the patch and remakes.  The classic
examples of this error are C</p><p>These days the most common mistake of this kind is sending a
diff with a huge band that is nothing but changebars between your
<b>configure</b> script and the maintainer&apos;s.  This file is
generated by <b>autoconf</b>.</p><p>This is inconsiderate.  It means your recipient is put to the trouble
of separating the real content of the patch from a lot of bulky noise.
It&apos;s a minor error, not as important as some of the things we&apos;ll get
to further on &#x2014; but it will count against you.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008059">Don&apos;t send patch bands that just tweak RCS or SCCS $-symbols.</a></h4></div></div><p>Some people put special tokens in their source files that are
expanded by the version-control system when the file is checked in:
the $Id$ construct used by RCS and CVS,
for example.</p><p>If you&apos;re using a local version-control system yourself, your
changes may alter these tokens.  This isn&apos;t really harmful, because
when your recipient checks his code back in after applying your patch
the tokens will be re-expanded in accordance with the
<span class="emphasis"><em>maintainer&apos;s</em></span> version-control status.  But those
extra patch bands are noise.  They&apos;re distracting.  It&apos;s more
considerate not to send them.</p><p>This is another minor error.  You&apos;ll be forgiven for it if you
get the big things right.  But you want to avoid it anyway.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008100">Do use <tt>-c</tt> or <tt>-u</tt> format, don&apos;t use the default (<tt>-e</tt>) format.</a></h4></div></div><p>The default (<tt>-e</tt>) format of
diff(1)
is very brittle.  It doesn&apos;t include any context, so the patch tool
can&apos;t cope if any lines have been inserted or deleted in the baseline 
code since you took the copy you modified.</p><p>Getting an <tt>-e</tt> diff is annoying, and suggests
that the sender is either an extreme newbie, careless, or clueless.
Most such patches get tossed out without a second thought.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008156">Do include documentation with your patch.</a></h4></div></div><p>This is very important.  If your patch makes a user-visible addition
or change to the software&apos;s features, <span class="emphasis"><em>include changes to the
appropriate man pages and other documentation files in your patch</em></span>.
Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> assume that the recipient will be happy to
document your code for you, or to have undocumented features lurking
in the code.</p><p>Documenting your changes well demonstrates some good things.  First,
it&apos;s considerate to the person you are trying to persuade.  Second, it
shows that you understand the ramifications of your change well enough
to explain it to somebody who can&apos;t see the code.  Third, it demonstrates
that you care about the people who will ultimately use the software.</p><p>Good documentation is usually the most visible sign of what separates
a solid contribution from a quick and dirty hack.  If you take the time
and care necessary to produce it, you&apos;ll find you&apos;re already 85% of the
way to having your patch accepted by most developers.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008201">Do include an explanation with your patch.</a></h4></div></div><p>Your patch should include cover notes explaining why you think the
patch is necessary or useful.  This is explanation directed not to the
users of the software but to the maintainer to whom you are sending the
patch.</p><p>The note can be short &#x2014; in fact, some of the most
effective cover notes I&apos;ve ever seen just said &#x201C;See the
documentation updates in this patch&#x201D;.  But it should show the
right attitude.</p><p>The right attitude is helpful, respectful of the maintainer&apos;s time,
quietly confident but unassuming.  It&apos;s good to display understanding of
the code you&apos;re patching.  It&apos;s good to show that you can identify with the
maintainer&apos;s problems. It&apos;s also good to be up front about any risks you
perceive in applying the patch.  Here are some examples of the sorts of
explanatory comments that experienced developers send:</p><p>&#x201C;I&apos;ve seen two problems with this code, X and Y.  I fixed
problem X, but I didn&apos;t try addressing problem Y because I don&apos;t think
I understand the part of the code that I believe is
involved&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;Fixed a core dump that can happen when one of the foo
inputs is too long.  While I was at it, I went looking for similar
overflows elsewhere.  I found a possible one in blarg.c, near line
666.  Are you sure the sender can&apos;t generate more than 80 characters
per transmission?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Have you considered using the Foonly algorithm for this
problem?  There is a good implementation at
<http: www.example.com ~jsmith foonly.html>&#x201D;.</http:></p><p>&#x201C;This patch solves the immediate problem, but I realize it
complicates the memory allocation in an unpleasant way.  Works for me,
but you should probably test it under heavy load before
shipping&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;This may be featuritis, but I&apos;m sending it anyway.
Maybe you&apos;ll know a cleaner way to implement the
feature&#x201D;.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008290">Do include useful comments in your code.</a></h4></div></div><p>A maintainer will want to have strong confidence that he
understands your changes before merging them in.  This isn&apos;t an
invariable rule; if you have a track record of good work with the
maintainer, he may just run a casual eye over the changes before
checking them in semiautomatically.  But everything you can do to
help him understand your code and decrease his uncertainty increases
your chances that your patch will be accepted.</p><p>Good comments in your code help the maintainer understand it.
Bad comments don&apos;t.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of a bad comment:</p><pre class="programlisting">
/* norman newbie fixed this 13 Aug 2001 */
</pre><p>This conveys no information.  It&apos;s nothing but a muddy
territorial bootprint you&apos;re planting in the middle of the
maintainer&apos;s code.  If he takes your patch (which you&apos;ve made less
likely) he will almost certainly strip out this comment.  If you want
a credit, include a patch band for the project
<tt>NEWS</tt> or <tt>HISTORY</tt> file.  He&apos;s
more likely to take that.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of a good comment:</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
 * This conditional needs to be guarded so that crunch_data() never
 * gets passed a NULL pointer.  <norman_newbie@foosite.com>
 */
</norman_newbie@foosite.com></pre><p>This comment shows that you understand not only the maintainer&apos;s
code but the kind of information that he needs to have confidence in
your changes.  This kind of comment <span class="emphasis"><em>gives</em></span> him
confidence in your changes.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008383">Don&apos;t take it personally if your patch is rejected</a></h4></div></div><p>There are lots of reasons a patch can be rejected that don&apos;t
reflect on you.  Remember that most maintainers are under heavy time
pressure, and have to be conservative in what they accept lest the
project code get broken.  Sometime resubmitting with improvements
will help.  Sometimes it won&apos;t.  Life is hard.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="naming">Good Project- and Archive-Naming Practice</a></h3></div></div><p>As the load on maintainers of archives like ibiblio, SourceForge,
and CPAN increases, there is an increasing trend for submissions
to be processed partly or wholly by programs (rather than entirely by
a human).</p><p>This makes it more important for project and archive-file names
to fit regular patterns that computer programs can parse and
understand.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3008426">Use GNU-style names with a stem and major.minor.patch numbering.</a></h4></div></div><p>It&apos;s helpful to everybody if your archive files all have GNU-like
names &#x2014; all-lower-case alphanumeric stem prefix, followed by a hyphen,
followed by a version number, extension, and other suffixes.</p><p>A good general form of name has these parts in order:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>project prefix</p></li><li><p>dash</p></li><li><p>version number</p></li><li><p>dot</p></li><li><p>&#x201C;src&#x201D; or &#x201C;bin&#x201D; (optional)</p></li><li><p>dot or dash (dot preferred)</p></li><li><p>binary type and options (optional)</p></li><li><p>archiving and compression extensions</p></li></ol></div><p>Name stems in this style can contain hyphen or underscores to
separate syllables; dashes are actually preferred.  It is good
practice to group related projects by giving the stems a common 
hyphen-terminated prefix.</p><p>Let&apos;s suppose you have a project you call &#x2018;foobar&#x2019;
at major version 1, minor version or release 2, patchlevel 3.  If it&apos;s
got just one archive part (presumably the sources), here&apos;s what its
names should look like like:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-1.2.3.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The source archive.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar.lsm</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The LSM file (assuming you&apos;re submitting to ibiblio).</p></dd></dl></div><p>Please <span class="emphasis"><em>don&apos;t</em></span> use names like these:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar123.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>This looks to many programs like an archive
for a project called &#x201C;foobar123&#x201D; with no version number.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar1.2.3.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>This looks to many programs like an archive
for a project called &#x201C;foobar1&#x201D; at version 2.3.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-v1.2.3.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Many programs think this goes with a
project called &#x201C;foobar-v1&#x201D;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foo_bar-1.2.3.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The underscore is hard for people to speak,
type, and remember.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>FooBar-1.2.3.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Unless you <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> looking like a
marketing weenie.  This is also hard for people to speak, type, and 
remember.</p></dd></dl></div><p>If you have to differentiate between source and binary archives, or
between different kinds of binary, or express some kind of build
option in the file name, please treat that as a file extension to go
<span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the version number. That is, please do this:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-1.2.3.src.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Sources.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-1.2.3.bin.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Binaries, type not specified.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-1.2.3.bin.i386.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>i386 binaries.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-1.2.3.bin.i386.static.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>i386 binaries statically linked.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>foobar-1.2.3.bin.SPARC.tar.gz</tt></span></dt><dd><p>SPARC binaries.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Please <span class="emphasis"><em>don&apos;t</em></span> use names like
&#x2018;foobar-i386-1.2.3.tar.gz&#x2019;, because programs have a hard
time telling type infixes (like &#x2018;-i386&#x2019;) from the
stem.</p><p>The convention for distinguishing major from minor release is
simple: you increment the patch level for fixes or minor features, the 
minor version number for compatible new features, and the major
version number when you make incompatible changes.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="local">But respect local conventions where appropriate.</a></h4></div></div><p>Some projects and communities have well-defined conventions for
names and version numbers that aren&apos;t necessarily compatible with the
above advice.  For instance,
Apache</p><p>Look for and respect the conventions of specialized
communities and developers; for general use, follow the above
guidelines.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="prefix">Try hard to choose a name prefix that is unique and easy to type.</a></h4></div></div><p>The stem prefix should be common to all of a project&apos;s files, and it
should be easy to read, type, and remember.  So please don&apos;t use
underscores.  And don&apos;t capitalize or BiCapitalize without extremely
good reason &#x2014; it messes up the natural human-eyeball search order and
looks like some marketing weenie trying to be clever.</p><p>It confuses people when two different projects have the same
stem name.  So try to check for collisions before your first release.
Two good places to check are the <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux" target="_top">index file of ibiblio</a>
and the application index at <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net" target="_top">Freshmeat</a>.  Another good place
to check is <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_top">SourceForge</a>;
do a name search there.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="develpractice">Good Development Practice</a></h3></div></div><p>Here are some of the behaviors that can make the difference 
between a successful project with lots of contributors and one that
stalls out after attracting no interest:</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="proprietary">Don&apos;t rely on proprietary code.</a></h4></div></div><p>Don&apos;t rely on proprietary languages, libraries, or other code.
Doing so is risky business at the best of times; in the open-source
community, it is considered downright rude. Open-source developers
don&apos;t trust code for which they can&apos;t review the source.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="autoconf">Use GNU Autotools.</a></h4></div></div><p>Configuration choices should be made at compile time. A
significant advantage of open-source distributions is that they allow
the package to adapt at compile-time to the environment it finds. This
is critical because it allows the package to run on platforms its
developers have never seen, and it allows the software&apos;s community of
users to do their own ports. Only the largest of development teams can
afford to buy all the hardware and hire enough employees to support
even a limited number of platforms.</p><p>Therefore: Use the GNU autotools to handle portability issues,
do system-configuration probes, and tailor your makefiles.  People
building from sources today expect to be able to type
<b>configure; make; make install</b> and get a clean build
&#x2014; and rightly so.  There is a <a href="http://seul.org/docs/autotut/" target="_top">good tutorial on these
tools</a>.</p><p><i>autoconf</i> and
<i>autoheader</i> are mature.
<i>automake</i>, as we&apos;ve previously noted, is
still buggy and brittle as of mid-2003; you may have to maintain
your own <tt>Makefile.in</tt>.  Fortunately
it&apos;s the least important of the autotools.</p><p>Regardless of your approach to configuration, do not ask the user
for system information at compile-time. The user installing the package
does not know the answers to your questions, and this approach is doomed
from the start. The software must be able to determine for itself any
information that it may need at compile- or install-time.</p><p>But <i>autoconf</i> should not be regarded
as a license for knob-ridden designs.  If at all possible, program to
standards like POSIX and refrain also from asking the system for
configuration information.  Keep ifdefs to a minimum &#x2014; or,
better yet, have none at all.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="testcode">Test your code before release.</a></h4></div></div><p>A good test suite allows the team to easily run regression tests
before releases. Create a strong, usable test framework so that you
can incrementally add tests to your software without having to train
developers in the specialized intricacies of the test suite.</p><p>Distributing the test suite allows the community of users to test
their ports before contributing them back to the group.</p><p>Encourage your developers to use a wide variety of platforms as
their desktop and test machines, so that code is continuously being
tested for portability flaws as part of normal development.</p><p>It is good practice, and encourages confidence in your code, when
it ships with the test suite you use, and that test suite can be run
with <b>make test</b>.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sanitycode">Sanity-check your code before release.</a></h4></div></div><p>By &#x201C;sanity check&#x201D; we mean: use every tool available
that has a reasonable chance of catching errors a human would be prone
to overlook. The more of these you catch with tools, the fewer your
users and you will have to contend with.</p><p>If you&apos;re writing C</p><p>Run tools that look for memory leaks and other runtime errors;
Electric Fence and Valgrind are two good ones available in open source.
</p><p>For Python</p><p>If you&apos;re writing Perl</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sanitydocs">Spell-check your documentation and READMEs before release.</a></h4></div></div><p>Spell-check your documentation, README files and error messages
in your software. Sloppy code, code that produces warning messages when
compiled, and spelling errors in README files or error messages, all lead
users to believe the engineering behind it is also haphazard and
sloppy.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="cport">Recommended C/C++ Portability Practices</a></h4></div></div><p>If you are writing C</p><p>Do not assume compiler-specific features such as the GCC
<tt>-pipe</tt> option or nested functions are available. These
will come around and bite you the second somebody ports to a
non-Linux, non-GCC system.</p><p>Code required for portability should be isolated to a single
area and a single set of source files (for example, an
<tt>os</tt> subdirectory).  Compiler, library and
operating system interfaces with portability issues should be
abstracted to files in this directory.</p><p>A portability layer is a library (or perhaps just a set of
macros in header files) that abstracts away just the parts of an
operating system&apos;s API your program is interested in.  Portability
layers make it easier to do new software ports. Often, no member of
the development team knows the porting platform (for example, there
are literally hundreds of different embedded operating systems, and
nobody knows any significant fraction of them). By creating a separate
portability layer, it becomes possible for a specialist who knows a
platform to port your software without having to understand anything
outside the portability layer.</p><p>Portability layers also simplify applications. Software rarely
needs the full functionality of more complex system calls such as
mmap(2)
or
stat(2),
and programmers commonly configure such complex interfaces
incorrectly. A portability layer with abstracted interfaces
(say, something named <tt>__file_exists</tt> instead of a call to
stat(2))
allows you to import only the limited, necessary functionality from
the system, simplifying the code in your application.</p><p>Always write your portability layer to select based on a
feature, never based on a platform. Trying to create a separate
portability layer for each supported platform results in a multiple
update problem maintenance nightmare. A &#x201C;platform&#x201D; is
always selected on at least two axes: the compiler and the
library/operating system release. In some cases there are three axes,
as when Linux vendors select a C</p><p>Portability choices can be made along either lines of code or
compiled files. It doesn&apos;t make a difference if you select alternate
lines of code on a platform, or one of a few different files. A rule
of thumb is to move portability code for different platforms into
separate files when the implementations diverge significantly (shared
memory mapping on Unix vs. Windows), and leave portability code in a
single file when the differences are minimal (for example, whether
you&apos;re using <tt>gettimeofday</tt>, <tt>clock_gettime</tt>, <tt>ftime</tt> or <tt>time</tt> to
find out the current time-of-day).</p><p>For anywhere outside a portability layer, heed this advice:</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#xFFFD;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p><tt>#ifdef</tt> and <tt>#if</tt> are last resorts, usually a sign of failure

portability layer. Outside it, try hard to confine these to
conditionalizing <tt>#includes</tt> based on feature
symbols.</p><p>Never intrude on the namespace of any other part of the system,
including filenames, error return values and function names.  Where
the namespace is shared, document the portion of the namespace that you
use.</p><p>Choose a coding standard. The debate over the choice of standard
can go on forever &#x2014; regardless, it is too difficult and
expensive to maintain software built using multiple coding standards,
and so some common style must be chosen. Enforce your coding standard
ruthlessly, as consistency and cleanliness of the code are of the
highest priority; the details of the coding standard itself are a
distant second.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="distpractice">Good Distribution-Making Practice</a></h3></div></div><p>These guidelines describe how your distribution should look when

tarballs that unpack the files and directories in the distribution into
the current directory, potentially overwriting files already located there.
<span class="emphasis"><em>Never do this!</em></span></p><p>Instead, make sure your archive files all have a common directory part
named after the project, so they will unpack into a single top-level

of your source distribution.  By ancient convention (originating with
Dennis Ritchie himself before 1980, and promulgated on
Usenet</p><p><tt>README</tt> files should be short and easy to
read.  Make yours an introduction, not an epic. Good things to have in
the <tt>README</tt> include the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A brief description of the project.</p></li><li><p>A pointer to the project website (if it has 
one).</p></li><li><p>Notes on the developer&apos;s build environment and

file containing same (usually
<tt>CREDITS</tt>).</p></li><li><p>Either recent project news or a pointer to a file
containing same (usually <tt>NEWS</tt>).</p></li><li><p>Project mailing list addresses.</p></li></ol></div><p>At one time this file was commonly <tt>READ.ME</tt>,
but this interacts badly with browsers, who are all too likely to
assume that the <tt>.ME</tt> suffix means it&apos;s not textual and can only be
downloaded rather than browsed.  This usage is deprecated.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="filenames">Respect and follow standard file-naming practices.</a></h4></div></div><p>Before even looking at the <tt>README</tt>, your
intrepid explorer will have scanned the filenames in the top-level
directory of your unpacked distribution.  Those names can themselves
convey information.  By adhering to certain standard naming practices,
you can give the explorer valuable clues about where to look
next.</p><p>Here are some standard top-level file names and what they mean.  Not
every distribution needs all of these.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">README</span></dt><dd><p>The roadmap file, to be read first.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">INSTALL</span></dt><dd><p>Configuration, build, and installation instructions.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">AUTHORS</span></dt><dd><p>List of project contributors (GNU convention).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">NEWS</span></dt><dd><p>Recent project news.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">HISTORY</span></dt><dd><p>Project history.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">CHANGES</span></dt><dd><p>Log of significant changes between revisions.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">COPYING</span></dt><dd><p>Project license terms (GNU convention).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">LICENSE</span></dt><dd><p>Project license terms.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">FAQ</span></dt><dd><p>Plain-text Frequently-Asked-Questions document for

are human-readable metainformation about the package, rather than
build components. This elaboration of the <tt>README</tt>
was developed early on at the Free Software
Foundation</p><p>Having a <tt>FAQ</tt> file can save you a lot of
grief.  When a question about the project comes up often, put it in
the FAQ; then direct users to read the FAQ before sending questions or
bug reports.  A well-nurtured FAQ can decrease the support burden on
the project maintainers by an order of magnitude or more.</p><p>Having a <tt>HISTORY</tt> or
<tt>NEWS</tt> file with timestamps in it for each release
is valuable.  Among other things, it may help establish prior art if
you are ever hit with a patent-infringement lawsuit (this hasn&apos;t
happened to anyone yet, but best to be prepared).</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="upgradability">Design for upgradability.</a></h4></div></div><p>Your software will change over time as you put out new releases.  Some
of these changes will not be backward-compatible.  Accordingly, you
should give serious thought to designing your installation layouts so
that multiple installed versions of your code can coexist on the same
system.  This is especially important for libraries &#x2014; you can&apos;t 
count on all your client programs to upgrade in lockstep with your
API changes.</p><p>The Emacs, Python, and Qt projects have a good convention for
handling this: version-numbered directories (another practice that
seems to have been made routine by the FSF</p><pre class="screen">
/usr/lib/qt
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}/bin          # Where you find moc
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}/lib          # Where you find .so
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}/include      # Where you find header files
</pre><p>With this organization, multiple versions can coexist.  Client
programs have to specify the library version they want, but that&apos;s a
small price to pay for not having the interfaces break on them.  This
good practice avoids the notorious <a href="ch03s02.html#dll_hell">&#x201C;DLL
Hell&#x201D;</a> failure mode of Windows.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="rpms">Under Linux, provide RPMs.</a></h4></div></div><p>The de facto standard format for installable binary packages
under Linux that used by the Red Hat Package manager, RPM.  It&apos;s
featured in the most popular Linux</p><p>It&apos;s also a good idea for you to include in your source tarball
the RPM spec file, with a production that makes RPMs from it in your
<tt>makefile</tt>.  The spec file should have the
extension <tt>.spec</tt>; that&apos;s how the
<i>rpm</i> <tt>-t</tt> option finds it in a
tarball.</p><p>For extra style points, generate your spec file with a
shellscript that automatically plugs in the correct version number by
analyzing the project <tt>makefile</tt> or a
<tt>version.h</tt>.</p><p>Note: If you supply source RPMs, use BuildRoot to make the
program be built in <tt>/tmp</tt> or
<tt>/var/tmp</tt>.  If you don&apos;t, during the course of
running the make install part of your build, the install will install
the files in the real final places. This will happen even if there are
file collisions, and even if you didn&apos;t want to install the package at
all. When you&apos;re done, the files will have been installed and your
system&apos;s RPM database will not know about it. Such badly behaved SRPMs
are a minefield and should be eschewed.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="checksums">Provide checksums.</a></h4></div></div><p>Provide checksums with your binaries (tarballs, RPMs, etc.).  This
will allow people to verify that they haven&apos;t been corrupted or had
Trojan-horse code inserted in them.</p><p>While there are several commands you can use for this purpose
(such as <b>sum</b> and <b>cksum</b>) it is
best to use a cryptographically-secure hash function.  The GPG package
provides this capability via the <tt>--detach-sign</tt>
option; so does the GNU command <b>md5sum</b>.</p><p>For each binary you ship, your project Web page should list
the checksum and the command you used to generate it.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="communication">Good Communication Practice</a></h3></div></div><p>Your software and documentation won&apos;t do the world much good if
nobody but you knows they exist.  Also, developing a visible presence for
the project on the Internet will assist you in recruiting users and
co-developers.  Here are the standard ways to do that.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="announce">Announce to Freshmeat.</a></h4></div></div><p>Announce to <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net" target="_top">Freshmeat</a>.
Besides being widely read itself, this group is a major feeder for 
Web-based technical news channels.</p><p>Never assume the audience has been reading your release
announcements since the beginning of time.  Always include at least a
one-line description of what the software does.  Bad example:
&#x201C;Announcing the latest release of FooEditor, now with themes
and ten times faster&#x201D;.  Good example: &#x201C;Announcing the
latest release of FooEditor, the scriptable editor for touch-typists, 
now with themes and ten times faster&#x201D;.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="newsgroup">Announce to a relevant topic newsgroup.</a></h4></div></div><p>Find a Usenet topic group directly relevant to your application,
and announce there as well.  Post only where the
<span class="emphasis"><em>function</em></span> of the code is relevant, and exercise
restraint.</p><p>If (for example) you are releasing a program written in Perl
that queries IMAP servers, you should certainly post to <tt>comp.mail.imap</tt>.  But you should probably
not post to <tt>comp.lang.perl</tt>
unless the program is also an instructive example of cutting-edge Perl
techniques.</p><p>Your announcement should include the URL of a project website.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="website">Have a website.</a></h4></div></div><p>If you intend trying to build any substantial user or developer community
around your project, it should have a website.  Standard things to have
on the website include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The project charter (why it exists, who the audience is, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Download links for the project sources.</p></li><li><p>Instructions on how to join the project mailing list(s).</p></li><li><p>A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list.</p></li><li><p>HTMLized versions of the project documentation.</p></li><li><p>Links to related and/or competing projects.</p></li></ul></div><p>Refer to the website examples in <a href="reusechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;16.&#xFFFD;Reuse">Chapter&#xFFFD;16</a> for examples of what a well-educated project
website looks like.</p><p>An easy way to have a website is to put your project on one of
the sites that specializes in providing free hosting. In 2003
the two most important of these are SourceForge (which is a
demonstration and test site for proprietary collaboration tools) or
Savannah (which hosts open-source projects as an ideological
statement).</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="lists">Host project mailing lists.</a></h4></div></div><p>It&apos;s standard practice to have a private development list
through which project collaborators can communicate and exchange
patches.  You may also want to have an announcements list for people
who want to be kept informed of the project&apos;s progress.</p><p>If you are running a project named &#x2018;foo&#x2019;, your
developer list might be <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:foo-dev">foo-dev</a>&gt;</tt> or
<tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:foo-friends">foo-friends</a>&gt;</tt>; your announcement list might be
<tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:foo-announce">foo-announce</a>&gt;</tt>.</p><p>An important decision is just how private the
&#x201C;private&#x201D; development list is.  Wider participation in
design discussions is often a good thing, but if the list is
relatively open, sooner or later you <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> get
people asking new-user questions on it.  Opinions vary on how best to
solve this problem.  Just having the documentation tell the new users
not to ask elementary questions on the development list is not a
solution; such a request must be enforced somehow.</p><p>An announcements list needs to be tightly controlled.  Traffic should be
at most a few messages a month; the whole purpose of such a list is to
accommodate people who want to know when something important happens, but
don&apos;t want to hear about day-to-day details.  Most such people will
quickly unsubscribe if the list starts generating significant clutter in
their mailboxes.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="archives">Release to major archives.</a></h4></div></div><p>See the section <i>Where Should I Look?</i> in
<a href="reusechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;16.&#xFFFD;Reuse">Chapter&#xFFFD;16</a> for specifics on
