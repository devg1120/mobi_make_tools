and applications software, service libraries, GUI toolkits and
hardware drivers are available for the taking. You can have most built
and running in minutes with standard tools.  The mantra is <b>
./configure; make; make install</b>; usually you have to be root
to do the install part.</p><p>People from outside the Unix world (especially non-technical
people) are prone to think open-source</p><p>Furthermore, the open-source user community (those peers) is not
shy about nailing bugs, and its standards are high. Authors who put
out substandard work experience a lot of social pressure to fix
their code or withdraw it, and can get a lot of skilled help fixing
it if they choose. As a result, mature open-source packages are
generally of high quality and often functionally superior to any
proprietary equivalent. They may lack polish and have documentation
that assumes much, but the vital parts will usually work quite
well.</p><p>Besides the peer-review effect, another reason to expect better
quality is this: in the open-source world developers are never forced
by a deadline to close their eyes, hold their noses, and ship.  A
major consequent difference between open-source practice and elsewhere
is that a release level of 1.0 actually means the software is ready to
use.  In fact, a version number of 0.90 or above is a fairly reliable
signal that the code is production-ready, but the developers are not
quite ready to bet their reputations on it.</p><p>If you are a programmer from outside the Unix world, you may
find this claim difficult to believe. If so, consider this: on modern
Unixes, the C</p><p>The way to evaluate an open-source</p><p>A good gauge of maturity and the volume of user feedback is the
number of people besides the original author mentioned in the
<tt>README</tt> and project news or history files in the
source distribution. Credits to lots of people for sending in fixes
and patches are signs both of a significant user base keeping the
authors on their toes, and of a conscientious maintainer who is
responsive to feedback and will take corrections.  It is also 
an indication that, if early code tends to be a minefield of bugs, 
there has since been a thundering herd run through it without
too many recent explosions.</p><p>It&apos;s also a good omen when the software has its own Web page,
on-line FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list, and an associated
mailing list or Usenet</p><p>Ports to multiple platforms are also a valuable indication of a
diversified user base.  Project pages tend to advertise new ports
precisely because they signal credibility.</p><p>Here are some examples of what Web pages associated with
high-quality open-source software look like:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_top">GIMP</a>
</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_top">GNOME</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_top">KDE</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.python.org" target="_top">Python</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.kernel.org" target="_top">The Linux kernel</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_top">PostgreSQL</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://xfree86.org" target="_top">XFree86</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/" target="_top">InfoZip</a></p></li></ul></div><p>Looking at Linux distributions is another good way to find quality.
Distribution-makers for Linux and other open-source Unixes carry
a lot of specialist expertise about which projects are best-of-breed
&#x2014; that&apos;s a large part of the value they add when they integrate
a release.  If you are already using an open-source Unix, something
else to check is whether the package you are evaluating is already
carried by your distribution.</p></div>
