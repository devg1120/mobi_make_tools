the successors of small experimental prototypes.  The urge to add
everything that was left out the first time around all too frequently
leads to huge and overcomplicated design.  Less well known, because
less common, is the &#x2018;third-system effect&#x2019;; sometimes,
after the second system has collapsed of its own weight, there is a
chance to go back to simplicity and get it really right.</p><p>The original Unix was a third system.  Its grandfather was the
small and simple Compatible Time-Sharing System

[<a href="apb.html#Ritchie-Thompson" title="[Ritchie-Thompson]">Ritchie-Thompson</a>] gave Unix its first public
exposure.  In that paper, its authors described the unprecedentedly
simple design of Unix, and reported over 600 Unix installations. All
were on machines underpowered even by the standards of that day, but
(as Ritchie and Thompson wrote) &#x201C;constraint has encouraged not
only economy, but also a certain elegance of design&#x201D;.</p><p>After the CACM paper, research labs and universities all over
the world clamored for the chance to try out Unix themselves.  Under a
1958 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, AT&amp;T
</p><p>This was years before personal computers. Not only was the
hardware needed to run Unix too expensive to be within an individual&apos;s
reach, but nobody imagined that would change in the foreseeable
future.  So Unix machines were only available by the grace of big
organizations with big budgets: corporations, universities,
government agencies. But use of these minicomputers was less regulated
than the even-bigger mainframes, and Unix development rapidly took on
a countercultural air.  It was the early 1970s; the pioneering Unix
programmers were shaggy hippies and hippie-wannabes.  They delighted
in playing with an operating system that not only offered them
fascinating challenges at the leading edge of computer science, but also
subverted all the technical assumptions and business practices that
went with Big Computing.  Card punches, COBOL, business suits, and
batch IBM</p><p>The excitement of those days is captured in this quote from
Douglas Comer: &#x201C;Many universities contributed to UNIX. At the
University of Toronto, the department acquired a 200-dot-per-inch
printer/plotter and built software that used the printer to simulate a
phototypesetter. At Yale University, students and computer scientists
modified the UNIX shell. At Purdue University, the Electrical
Engineering Department made major improvements in performance,
producing a version of UNIX that supported a larger number of
users. Purdue also developed one of the first UNIX computer
networks. At the University of California at Berkeley, students
developed a new shell and dozens of smaller utilities. By the late
1970s, when Bell Labs released Version 7 UNIX, it was clear that the
system solved the computing problems of many departments, and that it
incorporated many of the ideas that had arisen in universities. The
end result was a strengthened system. A tide of ideas had started a
new cycle, flowing from academia to an industrial laboratory, back to
academia, and finally moving on to a growing number of commercial
sites&#x201D; [<a href="apb.html#Comer" title="[Comer]">Comer</a>].</p><p>The first Unix of which it can be said that essentially all of
it would be recognizable to a modern Unix programmer was the Version 7
release in 1979.<sup>[<a id="id2879903" href="ch02s01.html#ftn.id2879903">15</a>]</sup>
The first Unix user group had formed the previous year. By this time
Unix was in use for operations support all through the Bell System
[<a href="apb.html#Hauben" title="[Hauben]">Hauben</a>], and had spread to universities as far away
as Australia, where John Lions&apos;s 1976 notes [<a href="apb.html#Lions" title="[Lions]">Lions</a>] on
the Version 6 source code became the first serious documentation of
the Unix kernel internals.  Many senior Unix hackers still treasure a

were removed from the 18,000 that made up the distribution, and a
number of minor changes were made to other files. In addition, the

until 2000, when SCO sold UnixWare and the original Unix source-code

side to that story; to tell it, we&apos;ll need to return to 1961 and the 
origins of the Internet hacker culture.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2881371" href="ch02s01.html#id2881371">13</a>] </sup>Ken Thompson
