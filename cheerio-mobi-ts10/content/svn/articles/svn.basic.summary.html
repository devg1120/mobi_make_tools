    <p>We covered a number of fundamental Subversion concepts in
        this chapter:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
            <li class="listitem">
                <p>We introduced the notions of the central repository,
                    the client working copy, and the array of repository
                    revision trees.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
                <p>We saw some simple examples of how two collaborators
                    can use Subversion to publish and receive changes from one
                    another, using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">copy-modify-merge</span>”</span>
                    model.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
                <p>We talked a bit about the way Subversion tracks and
                    manages information in a working copy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>At this point, you should have a good idea of how Subversion
        works in the most general sense. Armed with this knowledge, you
        should now be ready to move into the next chapter, which is a
        detailed tour of Subversion's commands and features.</p>
