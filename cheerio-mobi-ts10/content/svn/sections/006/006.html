    <p>
        Another common version control concept is a tag. A tag is
        just a <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">snapshot</span>&#x201D;</span> of a project in time. In
        Subversion, this idea already seems to be everywhere. Each
        repository revision is exactly that&#x2014;a snapshot of the
        filesystem after each commit.</p>
    <p>However, people often want to give more human-friendly names
        to tags, such as <code class="literal">release-1.0</code>. And they want
        to make snapshots of smaller subdirectories of the filesystem.
        After all, it&apos;s not so easy to remember that release 1.0 of a
        piece of software is a particular subdirectory of revision
        4822.</p>

        <p>Once again, <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> comes to the
            rescue. If you want to create a snapshot of
            <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> exactly as it looks in the
            <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision, make a copy of it:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/release-1.0 \
           -m &quot;Tagging the 1.0 release of the &apos;calc&apos; project.&quot;
Committed revision 902.
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This example assumes that a
            <code class="filename">/calc/tags</code> directory already exists. (If
            it doesn&apos;t, you can create it using <span class="command"><strong>svn
                    mkdir</strong></span>.) After the copy completes, the new
            <code class="filename">release-1.0</code> directory is forever a
            snapshot of how the <code class="filename">/trunk</code> directory
            looked in the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision at the time you
            made the copy. Of course, you might want to be more precise
            about exactly which revision you copy, in case somebody else
            may have committed changes to the project when you weren&apos;t
            looking. So if you know that revision 901 of
            <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> is exactly the snapshot you
            want, you can specify it by passing <code class="option">-r 901</code> to
            the <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> command.</p>
        <p>But wait a moment: isn&apos;t this tag creation procedure the
            same procedure we used to create a branch? Yes, in fact, it
            is. In Subversion, there&apos;s no difference between a tag and a
            branch. Both are just ordinary directories that are created
            by copying. Just as with branches, the only reason a copied
            directory is a <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">tag</span>&#x201D;</span> is because
            <span class="emphasis"><em>humans</em></span> have decided to treat it that way:
            as long as nobody ever commits to the directory, it forever
            remains a snapshot. If people start committing to it, it
            becomes a branch.</p>
        <p>If you are administering a repository, there are two
            approaches you can take to managing tags. The first approach
            is <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">hands off</span>&#x201D;</span>: as a matter of project policy,
            decide where your tags will live, and make sure all users know
            how to treat the directories they copy. (That is, make sure
            they know not to commit to them.) The second approach is more
            paranoid: you can use one of the access control scripts
            provided with Subversion to prevent anyone from doing anything
            but creating new copies in the tags area (see
            ). The paranoid approach,
            however, isn&apos;t usually necessary. If a user accidentally
            commits a change to a tag directory, you can simply undo the
            change as discussed in the previous section. This is version
            control, after all!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.tags.mkcomplex"></a>Creating a Complex Tag</h3>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Sometimes you may want a <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">snapshot</span>&#x201D;</span> that is
            more complicated than a single directory at a single
            revision.</p>
        <p>For example, pretend your project is much larger than our
            <code class="filename">calc</code> example: suppose it contains a
            number of subdirectories and many more files. In the course
            of your work, you may decide that you need to create a working
            copy that is designed to have specific features and bug fixes.
            You can accomplish this by selectively backdating files or
            directories to particular revisions (using <span class="command"><strong>svn
                    update</strong></span> with the <code class="option">-r</code> option
            liberally), by switching files and directories to particular
            branches (making use of <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>), or
            even just by making a bunch of local changes. When you&apos;re
            done, your working copy is a hodgepodge of repository
            locations from different revisions. But after testing, you
            know it&apos;s the precise combination of data you need to
            tag.</p>
        <p>Time to make a snapshot. Copying one URL to another won&apos;t
            work here. In this case, you want to make a snapshot of your
            exact working copy arrangement and store it in the repository.
            Luckily, <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> actually has four
            different uses (which you can read about in ), including the ability to copy a
            working copy tree to the repository:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ ls
my-working-copy/
$ svn copy my-working-copy \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/mytag \
           -m &quot;Tag my existing working copy state.&quot;
Committed revision 940.
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Now there is a new directory in the repository,
            <code class="filename">/calc/tags/mytag</code>, which is an exact
            snapshot of your working copy&#x2014;mixed revisions, URLs,
            local changes, and all.</p>
        <p>Other users have found interesting uses for this feature.
            Sometimes there are situations where you have a bunch of local
            changes made to your working copy, and you&apos;d like a
            collaborator to see them. Instead of running <span class="command"><strong>svn
                    diff</strong></span> and sending a patch file (which won&apos;t capture
            directory or symlink changes), you can
            use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">upload</span>&#x201D;</span> your
            working copy to a private area of the repository. Your
            collaborator can then either check out a verbatim copy of your
            working copy or use <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to receive
            your exact changes.</p>
        <p>While this is a nice method for uploading a quick snapshot
            of your working copy, note that this is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            a good way to initially create a branch. Branch creation should
            be an event unto itself, and this method conflates the creation
            of a branch with extra changes to files, all within a single revision.
            This makes it very difficult (later on) to identify a single
            revision number as a branch point.</p>
