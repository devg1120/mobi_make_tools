    <p>Before jumping into the broader topic of repository
        administration, let&apos;s further define what a repository is. How
        does it look? How does it feel? Does it take its tea hot or
        iced, sweetened, and with lemon? As an administrator, you&apos;ll be
        expected to understand the composition of a repository both from
        a literal, OS-level perspective&#x2014;how a repository looks and
        acts with respect to non-Subversion tools&#x2014;and from a
        logical perspective&#x2014;dealing with how data is represented
        <span class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the repository.</p>
    <p>Seen through the eyes of a typical file browser application
        (such as Windows Explorer) or command-line based filesystem
        navigation tools, the Subversion repository is just another
        directory full of stuff. There are some subdirectories with
        human-readable configuration files in them, some subdirectories
        with some not-so-human-readable data files, and so on. As in
        other areas of the Subversion design, modularity is given high
        regard, and hierarchical organization is preferred to cluttered
        chaos. So a shallow glance into a typical repository from a
        nuts-and-bolts perspective is sufficient to reveal the basic
        components of the repository:</p>

</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Here&apos;s a quick fly-by overview of what exactly you&apos;re seeing
        in this directory listing. (Don&apos;t get bogged down in the
        terminology&#x2014;detailed coverage of these components exists
        elsewhere in this and other chapters.)</p>

                    <p>Prior to Subversion 1.5, the on-disk repository structure
                        also always contained a <code class="filename">dav</code> subdirectory.
                        <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code> used this directory to store
                        information about
                        WebDAV <em class="firstterm">activities</em>&#x2014;mappings of
                        high-level WebDAV protocol concepts to Subversion commit
                        transactions. Subversion 1.5 changed that behavior, moving
                        ownership of the activities directory, and the ability to
                        configure its location, into <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code>
                        itself. Now, new repositories will not necessarily have
                        a <code class="filename">dav</code> subdirectory
                        unless <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code> is in use and hasn&apos;t
                        been configured to store its activities database elsewhere.
                        See  in
                         for more information.</p>

    <p>Of course, when accessed via the Subversion libraries, this
        otherwise unremarkable collection of files and directories
        suddenly becomes an implementation of a virtual, versioned
        filesystem, complete with customizable event triggers. This
        filesystem has its own notions of directories and files, very
        similar to the notions of such things held by real filesystems
        (such as NTFS, FAT32, ext3, etc.). But this is a special
        filesystem&#x2014;it hangs these directories and files from
        revisions, keeping all the changes you&apos;ve ever made to them
        safely stored and forever accessible. This is where the
        entirety of your versioned data lives.</p>

                Subversion doesn&apos;t dictate that the versioned data live
                here, and there are known (albeit proprietary) alternative
                backend storage implementations which do not, in fact,
                store data in this directory.</p>
