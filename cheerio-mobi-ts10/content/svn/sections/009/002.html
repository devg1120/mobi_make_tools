    <p><em class="firstterm">Localization</em> is the act of making
        programs behave in a region-specific way. When a program
        formats numbers or dates in a way specific to your part of the
        world or prints messages (or accepts input) in your native
        language, the program is said to
        be <em class="firstterm">localized</em>. This section describes
        steps Subversion has made toward localization.</p>

        <p>Most modern operating systems have a notion of the
            <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">current locale</span>&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;that is, the region or
            country whose localization conventions are honored. These
            conventions&#x2014;typically chosen by some runtime
            configuration mechanism on the computer&#x2014;affect the way
            in which programs present data to the user, as well as the way
            in which they accept user input.</p>
        <p>On most Unix-like systems, you can check the values of the
            locale-related runtime configuration options by running the
            <span class="command"><strong>locale</strong></span> command:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ locale
LANG=
LC_COLLATE=&quot;C&quot;
LC_CTYPE=&quot;C&quot;
LC_MESSAGES=&quot;C&quot;
LC_MONETARY=&quot;C&quot;
LC_NUMERIC=&quot;C&quot;
LC_TIME=&quot;C&quot;
LC_ALL=&quot;C&quot;
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The output is a list of locale-related environment
            variables and their current values. In this example, the
            variables are all set to the default <code class="literal">C</code>
            locale, but users can set these variables to specific
            country/language code combinations. For example, if one were
            to set the <code class="literal">LC_TIME</code> variable to
            <code class="literal">fr_CA</code>, programs would know to present
            time and date information formatted according to a
            French-speaking Canadian&apos;s expectations. And if one were to
            set the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable to
            <code class="literal">zh_TW</code>, programs would know to present
            human-readable messages in Traditional Chinese. Setting the
            <code class="literal">LC_ALL</code> variable has the effect of changing
            every locale variable to the same value. The value of
            <code class="literal">LANG</code> is used as a default value for any
            locale variable that is unset. To see the list of available
            locales on a Unix system, run the command <strong class="userinput"><code>locale
                    -a</code></strong>.</p>
        <p>On Windows, locale configuration is done via the
            <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">Regional and Language Options</span>&#x201D;</span> control panel
            item. There you can view and select the values of individual
            settings from the available locales, and even customize (at a
            sickening level of detail) several of the display formatting
            conventions.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion client, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>, honors the
            current locale configuration in two ways. First, it notices
            the value of the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable and
            attempts to print all messages in the specified language. For
            example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
$ svn help cat
cat: Gibt den Inhalt der angegebenen Dateien oder URLs aus.
Aufruf: cat ZIEL[@REV]...
&#x2026;
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows
            systems. Note, though, that while your operating system might
            have support for a certain locale, the Subversion client still
            may not be able to speak the particular language. In order to
            produce localized messages, human volunteers must provide
            translations for each language. The translations are written
            using the GNU gettext package, which results in translation
            modules that end with the <code class="filename">.mo</code> filename
            extension. For example, the German translation file is named
            <code class="filename">de.mo</code>. These translation files are
            installed somewhere on your system. On Unix, they typically
            live in <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/</code>, while
            on Windows they&apos;re often found in the
            <code class="filename">share\locale\</code> folder in Subversion&apos;s
            installation area. Once installed, a module is named after
            the program for which it provides translations. For example, the
            <code class="filename">de.mo</code> file may ultimately end up
            installed as
            <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</code>.
            By browsing the installed <code class="filename">.mo</code> files, you
            can see which languages the Subversion client is able to
            speak.</p>
        <p>The second way in which the locale is honored involves how
            <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> interprets your input. The repository
            stores all paths, filenames, and log messages in Unicode,
            encoded as UTF-8. In that sense, the repository is
            <em class="firstterm">internationalized</em>&#x2014;that is, the
            repository is ready to accept input in any human language.
            This means, however, that the Subversion client is responsible
            for sending only UTF-8 filenames and log messages into the
            repository. To do this, it must convert the data
            from the native locale into UTF-8.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you create a file named
            <code class="filename">caff&#xE8;.txt</code>, and then when committing the
            file, you write the log message as <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">Adesso il caff&#xE8; &#xE8;
                    pi&#xF9; forte.</span>&#x201D;</span> Both the filename and the log message contain
            non-ASCII characters, but because your locale is set to
            <code class="literal">it_IT</code>, the Subversion client knows to
            interpret them as Italian. It uses an Italian character set
            to convert the data to UTF-8 before sending it off to the
            repository.</p>
        <p>Note that while the repository demands UTF-8 filenames and
            log messages, it <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span> pay attention
            to file contents. Subversion treats file contents as opaque
            strings of bytes, and neither client nor server makes an
            attempt to understand the character set or encoding of the
            contents.</p>
        <div class="sidebar">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="title">
                            <strong>Character Set Conversion Errors</strong>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>While using Subversion, you might get hit with an error
                related to character set conversions:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
                <pre class="screen">
svn: E000022: Can&apos;t convert string from native encoding to &apos;UTF-8&apos;:
&#x2026;
svn: E000022: Can&apos;t convert string from &apos;UTF-8&apos; to native encoding:
&#x2026;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Errors such as this typically occur when the Subversion
                client has received a UTF-8 string from the repository, but
                not all of the characters in that string can be represented
                using the encoding of the current locale. For example, if
                your locale is <code class="literal">en_US</code> but a collaborator
                has committed a Japanese filename, you&apos;re likely to see this
                error when you receive the file during an <span class="command"><strong>svn
                        update</strong></span>.</p>
            <p>The solution is either to set your locale to something
                that <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> represent the incoming UTF-8
                data, or to change the filename or log message in the
                repository. (And don&apos;t forget to slap your collaborator&apos;s
                hand&#x2014;projects should decide on common languages ahead of
                time so that all participants are using the same
                locale.)</p>
