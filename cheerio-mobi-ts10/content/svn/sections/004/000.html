    <p>Theory is useful, but its application is just plain fun.
        Let&apos;s move now into the details of using Subversion. By the time
        you reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to perform all
        the tasks you need to use Subversion in a normal day&apos;s work.
        You&apos;ll start with getting your files into Subversion, followed by
        an initial checkout of your code. We&apos;ll then walk you through
        making changes and examining those changes. You&apos;ll also see how
        to bring changes made by others into your working copy, examine
        them, and work through any conflicts that might arise.</p>
    <p>This chapter will not provide exhaustive coverage
        of all of Subversion&apos;s commands&#x2014;rather, it&apos;s a conversational
        introduction to the most common Subversion tasks that you&apos;ll
        encounter. This chapter assumes that you&apos;ve read and understood
         and are familiar with the general
        model of Subversion. For a complete reference of all commands,
        see .</p>
    <p>Also, this chapter assumes that the reader is seeking
        information about how to interact in a basic fashion with an
        existing Subversion repository. No repository means no working
        copy; no working copy means not much of interest in this chapter.
        There are many Internet sites which offer free or inexpensive
        Subversion repository hosting services. Or, if you&apos;d prefer to
        set up and administer your own repositories, check out
        . But don&apos;t expect the
        examples in this chapter to work without the user having access
        to a Subversion repository.</p>
    <p>Finally, any Subversion operation that contacts the repository
        over a network may potentially require that the user authenticate.
        For the sake of simplicity, our examples throughout this chapter
        avoid demonstrating and discussing authentication. Be aware that
        if you hope to apply the knowledge herein to an existing,
        real-world Subversion instance, you&apos;ll probably be forced to
        provide at least a username and password to the server. See
         for a detailed
        description of Subversion&apos;s handling of authentication and client
        credentials.</p>
