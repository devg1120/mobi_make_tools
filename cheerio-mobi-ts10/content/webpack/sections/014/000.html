<h1>Why webpack</h1>
<p>To understand why you should use webpack, let&apos;s recap how we used JavaScript on the web before bundlers were a thing.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run JavaScript in a browser. First, include a script for each functionality; this solution is hard to scale because loading too many scripts can cause a network bottleneck. The second option is to use a big <code>.js</code> file containing all your project code, but this leads to problems in scope, size, readability and maintainability.</p>
