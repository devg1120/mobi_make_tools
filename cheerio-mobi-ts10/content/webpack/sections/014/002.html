<p>webpack runs on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that can be used in computers and servers outside a browser environment.</p>
<p>When Node.js was released a new era started, and it came with new challenges. Now that JavaScript is not running in a browser, how are Node applications supposed to load new chunks of code? There are no html files and script tags that can be added to it.</p>
<p>CommonJS came out and introduced <code>require</code>, which allows you to load and use a module in the current file. This solved scope issues out of the box by importing each module as it was needed.</p>
