<h1>Targets</h1>
<p>Because JavaScript can be written for both server and browser, webpack offers multiple deployment <em>targets</em> that you can set in your webpack <a href="/configuration">configuration</a>.</p>

    <p>The webpack <code>target</code> property is not to be confused with the <code>output.libraryTarget</code> property. For more information see <a href="/concepts/output/">our guide</a> on the <code>output</code> property.</p>
