      <p>This appendix is a guide for CVS users new to Subversion.
    It&apos;s essentially a list of differences between the two systems
    as <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">viewed from 10,000 feet.</span>&#x201D;</span>  For each section, we
    provide references to relevant chapters when
    possible.</p>
      <p>Although the goal of Subversion is to take over the current
    and future CVS user base, some new features and design changes
    were required to fix certain <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">broken</span>&#x201D;</span> behaviors
    that CVS had.  This means that, as a CVS user, you may need to
    break habits&#x2014;ones that you forgot were odd to begin
    with.</p>
