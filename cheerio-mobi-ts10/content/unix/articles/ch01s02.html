        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Unix was born in 1969 and has been in continuous production use
        ever since. That's several geologic eras by computer-industry
        standards — older than the PC or workstations or microprocessors
        or even video display terminals, and contemporaneous with the first
        semiconductor memories. Of all production timesharing systems today,
        only IBM's VM/CMS can claim to have existed longer, and Unix machines
        have provided hundreds of thousands of times more service hours;
        indeed, Unix has probably supported more computing than all other
        timesharing systems put together.</p>
    <p>Unix has found use on a wider variety of machines than any other
        operating system can claim. From supercomputers to handhelds and
        embedded networking hardware, through workstations and servers and PCs
        and minicomputers, Unix has probably seen more architectures and more
        odd hardware than any three other operating systems combined.</p>
    <p>Unix has supported a mind-bogglingly wide spectrum of uses. No
        other operating system has shone simultaneously as a research vehicle,
        a friendly host for technical custom applications, a platform for
        commercial-off-the-shelf business software, and a vital component
        technology of the Internet.</p>
    <p>Confident predictions that Unix would wither away, or be crowded
        out by other operating systems, have been made yearly since its
        infancy. And yet Unix, in its present-day avatars as
        Linux<a id="id2876884" class="indexterm">
            and BSD and Solaris and MacOS X and half a dozen other variants,
            seems stronger than ever today.</a></p>

    <p>At least one of Unix's central technologies — the C
        language — has been widely naturalized elsewhere. Indeed it is
        now hard to imagine doing software engineering without
        C<a id="id2876947" class="indexterm"> as a ubiquitous
            common language of systems programming. Unix also introduced both the
            now-ubiquitous tree-shaped file namespace with directory nodes and
            the pipeline for connecting programs.</a></p>
    <p>Unix's durability and adaptability have been nothing short of
        astonishing. Other technologies have come and gone like mayflies.
        Machines have increased a thousandfold in power, languages have
        mutated, industry practice has gone through multiple revolutions —
        and Unix hangs in there, still producing, still paying the bills,
        and still commanding loyalty from many of the best and brightest
        software technologists on the planet.</p>
    <p>One of the many consequences of the exponential
        power-versus-time curve in computing, and the corresponding pace of
        software development, is that 50% of what one knows becomes obsolete
        over every 18 months. Unix does not abolish this phenomenon, but does
        do a good job of containing it. There's a bedrock of unchanging
        basics — languages, system calls, and tool invocations —
        that one can actually keep using for years, even decades. Elsewhere
        it is impossible to predict what will be stable; even entire operating
        systems cycle out of use. Under Unix, there is a fairly sharp
        distinction between transient knowledge and lasting knowledge, and one
        can know ahead of time (with about 90% certainty) which category
        something is likely to fall in when one learns it. Thus the loyalty
        Unix commands.</p>
    <p>Much of Unix's stability and success has to be attributed to its
        inherent strengths, to design decisions Ken
        Thompson<a id="id2876997" class="indexterm">,
            Dennis Ritchie<a id="id2877006" class="indexterm">, Brian
                Kernighan<a id="id2877015" class="indexterm">, Doug McIlroy<a id="id2877023" class="indexterm">, Rob Pike<a id="id2877032" class="indexterm"> and other early Unix developers made back at
                            the beginning; decisions that have been proven sound over and
                            over. But just as much is due to the design philosophy, art of
                            programming, and technical culture that grew up around Unix in the
                            early days. This tradition has continuously and successfully
                            propagated itself in symbiosis with Unix ever since.</a></a></a></a></a></p>
