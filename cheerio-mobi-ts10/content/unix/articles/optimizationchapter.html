    <p>This is going to be a very short chapter, because the main thing
        Unix experience teaches us about optimizing for performance is how to
        know when not to do it. A secondary lesson is that the most effective
        optimization tactics are usually things we do for other reasons, such as
        cleanness of design.</p>
