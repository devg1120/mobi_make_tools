    <p>There are three major issues in using or re-using
        open-source<a id="id2990934" class="indexterm">
            software; quality, documentation, and licensing terms. We've seen
            above that if you exercise a little judgment in picking through your
            alternatives, you will generally find one or more of quite respectable
            quality.</a></p>
    <p>Documentation is often a more serious issue. Many high-quality
        open-source packages are less useful than they technically ought to be
        because they are poorly documentated. Unix tradition encourages a
        rather hieratic style of documentation, one which (while it may
        technically capture all of a package's features) assumes that the
        reader is intimately familiar with the application domain and reading
        very carefully. There are good reasons for this, which we'll discuss
        in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter�18.�Documentation">Chapter�18</a>, but the
        style can present a bit of a barrier. Fortunately, extracting value
        from it is a learnable skill.</p>
    <p>It is worth doing a Web search for phrases including the
        software package, or topic keywords, and the string “HOWTO” or
        “FAQ”. These queries will often turn up documentation
        more useful to novices than the man page.</p>
    <p>The most serious issue in reusing open-source software
        (especially in any kind of commercial product) is understanding what
        obligations, if any, the package's license puts upon you. In the next
        two sections we'll discuss this issue in detail.</p>
