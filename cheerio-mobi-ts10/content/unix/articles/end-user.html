    <p>On another occasion when Master Foo gave public instruction, an
        end user, having heard tales of the Master's wisdom, came to him for
        guidance.</p>
    <p>He bowed three times to Master Foo. “I wish to learn the
        Great Way of Unix”, he said “but the command line
        confuses me”.</p>
    <p>Some of the onlooking neophytes began to mock the end user,
        calling him “clueless” and saying that the Way of
        Unix is only for those of discipline and intelligence.</p>
    <p>The Master held up a hand for silence, and called the most
        obstreperous of the neophytes who had mocked forward, to where
        he and the end user sat.</p>
    <p>“Tell me”, he asked the neophyte, “of the
        code you have written and the works of design you have
        uttered”.</p>
    <p>The neophyte began to stammer out a reply, but fell silent.</p>
    <p>Master Foo turned to the end-user. “Tell me”, he
        inquired, “why do you seek the Way?”</p>
    <p>“I am discontent with the software I see around
        me”, the end user replied. “It neither performs reliably
        nor pleases the eye and hand. Having heard that the Unix way, though
        difficult, is superior, I seek to cast aside all snares and
        delusions”.</p>
    <p>“And what do you do in the world”, asked Master Foo,
        “that you must strive with software?”</p>
    <p>“I am a builder”, the end user replied, “Many
        of the houses of this town were made under my chop”.</p>
    <p>Master Foo turned back to the neophyte. “The housecat may
        mock the tiger”, said the master, “but doing so will not
        make his purr into a roar”.</p>
    <p>Upon hearing this, the neophyte was enlightened.</p>
