    <p>The term &#x201C;UNIX&#x201D; is technically and legally a
        trademark of The Open Group, and should formally be used only for
        operating systems which are certified to have passed The Open Group&apos;s
        elaborate standards-conformance tests. In this book we use
        &#x201C;Unix&#x201D; in the looser sense widely current among
        programmers, to refer to any operating system (whether formally
        Unix-branded or not) that is either genetically descended from Bell
        Labs&apos;s ancestral Unix code or written in close imitation of its
        descendants. In particular, Linux (from which we draw most of our
        examples) is a Unix under this definition.</p>
    <p>This book employs the Unix manual page convention of tagging
        Unix facilities with a following manual section in parentheses,
        usually on first introduction when we want to emphasize that this is a
        Unix command. Thus, for example, read &#x201C;munger(1)&#x201D; as
        &#x201C;the &#x2018;munger&#x2019; program, which will be documented in
        section 1 (user tools) of the Unix manual pages, if it&apos;s present on
        your system&#x201D;. Section 2 is C system calls, section 3 is C
        library calls, section 5 is file formats and protocols, section 8 is
        system administration tools. Other sections vary among Unixes but
        are not cited in this book. For more, type <b>man 1
            man</b> at your Unix shell prompt (older System V Unixes may
        require <b>man -s 1 man</b>).</p>
    <p>Sometimes we mention a Unix application (such as
        <i>Emacs</i>), without a manual-section suffix and
        capitalized. This is a clue that the name actually represents a
        well-established family of Unix programs with essentially the same
        function, and we are discussing generic properties of all of them.
        <i>Emacs</i>, for example, includes
        <i>xemacs</i>.</p>
    <p>At various points later in this book we refer to
        &#x2018;old school&#x2019; and &#x2018;new school&#x2019; methods. As
        with rap music, new-school starts about 1990. In this context, it&apos;s
        associated with the rise of scripting
        languages</p>
