    </div>
    <p>When is designing a minilanguage appropriate? We&apos;ve observed
        that minilanguages offer a way to push problem specifications to a
        higher level, and seen how this operates in several case studies. The
        flip side of this observation is that a minilanguage is likely to be a
        good approach whenever the domain primitives in your application area
        are simple and stereotyped, but the ways in which users are likely to
        want to apply them are fluid and varying.</p>
    <p>For some related ideas, find a description of the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers" target="_top">Alternate
            Hard And Soft Layers</a> and <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~np2/patterns/scripting/scripting.html" target="_top">Scripted

        minilanguages is </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The first important thing to bear in mind when designing a
            minilanguage is, as usual, to keep it as simple as possible. The
            taxonomy diagram we used to organize the case studies implies a
            hierarchy of complexity; you want to keep your design as far toward the
            left-hand edge as possible. If you can get away with designing a
            structured data file rather than a minilanguage that is going to
            modify external data when it&apos;s interpreted, by all means do
            so.</p>
        <p>One very pragmatic reason to stick with structured data rather
            than a minilanguage is that in a networked world, embedded
            minilanguage facilities are subject to abuses that can be inconvenient
            or even dangerous. JavaScript</p>
        <p>Microsoft Word</p>
        <p>If there is any way that your application&apos;s users might end up
            running programs from untrusted sources, risky features of your
            application minilanguage might end up having to be suppressed.
            Languages like Java and JavaScript are explicitly
            <i>sandboxed</i>&#x2014;that is, they have limited
            access to their environment not merely to simplify their design but to
            try to prevent potentially destructive operations by buggy or
            malicious code.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a lot of bad designs have been
            botched by designers who failed to face up to the fact that they
            really needed a minilanguage rather than a data-file format. Too
            often, language-like features get pasted on as an afterthought.
            The two most common symptoms of this problem are weak, ad-hoc control
            structures and poor or nonexistent facilities for declaring
            procedures.</p>
        <p>It&apos;s risky to design minilanguages that are only accidentally
            Turing-complete. If you do this the odds are good that, sometime in
            the future, some clever fellow is going to think he needs to press
            your language into doing loops and conditionals for him. Because
            these are only available in an obfuscated way, he&apos;ll produce
            obfuscated code. The results may be serviceable in the short term,
            but are likely to be a nightmare for those who come after him.</p>
        <p>Minilanguage design is both powerful and esthetically rewarding,
            but it&apos;s also full of similar traps. There are kinds of design in
            which it is appropriate to take the bottom-up approach of pasting
            together a bunch of low-level services and worrying about their
            organization after you have explored the problem domain for a
            while. One of the virtues of minilanguages is that they can help you
            get a good design out of bottom-up programming by allowing you to
            defer some top-down decisions into the control flow of programs in
            your minilanguage. But if you take a bottom-up approach to the minilanguage
            design <span class="emphasis"><em>itself</em></span>, you are likely to end up with an
            ugly syntax reflecting a weak language and a poorly-thought-out
            implementation.</p>
        <p>There are many places in a minilanguage design where small
            choices make a large difference in the useability and ease of the
            tool:</p>

                        <p>As a language designer, it is a good principle to consider the
                            alternatives to giving an error message. When there is true ambiguity
                            in the intent of the programmer an error message is appropriate, but
                            in many cases the intent is clear, and making the language silently do
                            the right thing is a great boon. A good example is C accommodating an
                            extra comma at the end of an array initializer list, which makes both
                            editing and machine generation of array initializers much easier.
                            Anti-examples are the pickiness of various HTML readers, especially
                            their habit of silently discarding parts of your document because of
                            trivial nesting errors.</p>

        <p>On this issue, as elsewhere, there is no substitute for good
            taste and engineering judgment. If you&apos;re going to design a
            minilanguage, don&apos;t do it halfway. Declarative minilanguages should
            have a clear, consistent language-like syntax designed to be readable
            by humans. Imperative ones should add a full range of control
            structures adapted from language models you can expect your users to
            be familiar with. Think about the language <span class="emphasis"><em>as</em></span> a
            language; ask yourself esthetic questions like &#x201C;Will this be
            comfortable to program in?&#x201D; and even &#x201C;Will it be pleasant
            to look at?&#x201D; Here, as elsewhere in software design, David
            Gelernter&apos;s maxim is apt: beauty is the ultimate defense against
            complexity.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>One fundamentally important question is whether you can
            implement your minilanguage by extending or embedding an existing
            scripting language</p>
        <p>Sometimes it&apos;s possible to write your imperative language simply
            by coding service functions in an interpreted language, which we&apos;ll
            call the &#x2018;host&#x2019; language for purposes of this
            discussion. Your minilanguage programs are then just scripts that load
            your service library and use the host language&apos;s control structures
            and other facilities as a framework. Every facility the host language
            supplies is one you don&apos;t have to write.</p>
        <p>This is the easiest way to write a minilanguage. Old-school
            Lisp</p>
        <p>Your host language may be unable to interface to a code library
            that you need. Or, internally, its ontology of data types may be
            inadequate for the kind of computation you need to do. Or, after
            measuring the performance of a prototype, you discover that it&apos;s too
            slow. When any of these things happen, your solution is usually
            going to involve coding in C</p>
        <p>The option of extending a scripting
            language</p>
        <p>Both techniques also rely on the ability to move data between
            the type ontology of C and the type ontology of your scripting
            language. Some scripting languages are designed from the ground up to
            support this. One such is Tcl</p>
        <p>It is possible (though in 2003 still rather painful and
            difficult) to extend or embed Perl</p>
        <p>There are lots of bad reasons not to piggyback your imperative
            minilanguage on an existing scripting
            language</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>For declarative minilanguages, one major question is whether or
            not you should use XML as a base syntax and specify your grammar as an
            XML document type. This may well be the right thing for elaborately
            structured declarative minilanguages, but the same caveats we noted in
            <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a> about the
            design of data-file formats apply &#x2014; XML might be overkill. If
            you don&apos;t use XML, follow the Rule of Least Surprise by supporting the
            Unix conventions we described for data files (simple token-oriented
            syntax, supporting C</p>
        <p>If you do need a custom grammar, <i>yacc</i>
            and <i>lex</i> (or their local equivalent in the
            language you&apos;re using) should probably be your best friends, unless
            the grammar of your language is so simple that hand-coding a
            recursive-descent parser is trivial. Even then,
            <i>yacc</i> may give you better error recovery,
            and a <i>yacc</i> specification will be easier to
            modify as the language syntax evolves. See <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;9.&#xFFFD;Generation">Chapter&#xFFFD;9</a> for a look at the
            <i>yacc</i>- and
            <i>lex</i>-derived tools available in different
            implementation languages.</p>
        <p>Even if you decide you must implement your own syntax, consider
            what mileage you can get from reusing existing tools. If you need a
            macro facility, consider whether preprocessing with
            m4(1)
            might be the right answer &#x2014; but consider the cautions in the
            next section first.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Macro expansion facilities were a favored tactic for language
            designers in early Unix; the C</p>
        <p>Macro expansion is easy to specify and implement, and you can do
            a lot of cute tricks with it. Those early designers appear to have been
            influenced by experience with assemblers, in which macro facilities
            were often the only device available for structuring programs.</p>
        <p>The strength of macro expansion is that it knows nothing about
            the underlying syntax of the base language, and can be used to extend
            that syntax. Unfortunately, this power is very easily abused to
            produce code that is opaque, surprising, and a fertile source of
            hard-to-characterize bugs.</p>
        <p>In C, the classic example of this sort of problem is a macro
            such as this:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
#define max(x, y)	x &gt; y ? x : y
</pre>
        <p>There are at least two problems with this macro. One is that it
            can produce surprising results if either of the arguments is an
            expression including an operator of lower precedence than <tt>&gt;</tt> or <tt>?:</tt>.
            Consider the expression <tt>max(a = b,
                ++c)</tt>. If the programmer has forgotten that <tt>max</tt> is a macro, he will be expecting the
            assignment <tt>a = b</tt> and the preincrement
            operation on <tt>c</tt> to be executed before
            the resulting values are passed as arguments to <tt>max</tt>.</p>
        <p>But that&apos;s not what will happen. Instead, the preprocessor will
            expand this expression to <tt>a = b &gt; ++c ? a = b :
                ++c</tt>, which the C compiler&apos;s precedence rules make it
            interpret as <tt>a = (b &gt; ++c ? a = b :
                ++c)</tt>. The effect will be to assign to <tt>a</tt>!</p>
        <p>This sort of bad interaction can be headed off by coding the
            macro definition more defensively.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
#define max(x, y)	((x) &gt; (y) ? (x) : (y))
</pre>
        <p>With this definition, the expansion would be <tt>((a = b) &gt; (++c) ? (a = b) : (++c))</tt>. This
            solves one problem &#x2014; but notice that <tt>c</tt> may be incremented twice! There are subtler
            versions of this trap, such as passing the macro a function-call with
            side effects.</p>
        <p>In general, interactions between macros and expressions with
            side effects can lead to unfortunate results that are hard to
            diagnose. C&apos;s macro processor is a deliberately lightweight and
            simple one; more powerful ones can actually get you in worse
            trouble.</p>
        <p>The <i>TeX</i> formatting
            language (see <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;18.&#xFFFD;Documentation">Chapter&#xFFFD;18</a>) well illustrates the general
            problem. <i>TeX</i> is intentionally
            Turing-complete (it has conditionals, loops, and recursion), but while
            it can be made to do amazing things, <i>TeX</i> code tends to be unreadable and
            painful to debug. The sources for <i>LaTeX</i>, the the most widely used <i>TeX</i> macro package, are an instructive
            example: they&apos;re in very good <i>TeX</i> style, but even so are extremely
            difficult to follow.</p>
        <p>A minor problem, compared to this one, is that macro expansion
            tends to screw up error diagnostics. The base language processor
            generates its error reports relative to the macro expanded text, not
            the original the programmer is looking at. If the relationship
            between the two has been obfuscated by macro expansion, the emitted
            diagnostic can be very difficult to associate with the actual
            location of the error.</p>
        <p>This is especially a problem with preprocessors and macros
            that can have multiline expansions, conditionally include or exclude
            text, or otherwise change line numbers in the expanded text. </p>
        <p>Macro expansion stages that are built into a language can do
            their own compensation, fiddling line numbers to refer back to the
            preexpanded text. The macro facility in
            pic(1)
            does this, for example. This problem is more difficult to solve when
            the macro expansion is done by a preprocessor.</p>
        <p>The C preprocessor</p>
        <p>These are reasons to use macro expansion with extreme caution.
            One of the long-term lessons of the Unix experience is that macros
            tend to create more problems than they solve. Modern language and
            minilanguage designs have moved away from them.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Another important question you need to ask is whether your
            minilanguage engine will be called interactively by other
            programs, as a slave process. If so, your design should probably look
            less like a conversational language for human interaction and more
            like the kind of application protocols we looked at in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a>.</p>
        <p>The main difference is how carefully marked the boundaries
            of transactions are. Human beings are good at spotting where
            conversational output from a CLI ends, and where the prompt for the
            next input is. They can use context to tell what&apos;s significant and
            what should be ignored. Computer programs have much more trouble with
            this. Without either unambiguous end markers on output or advance
            knowledge of the length of the output, they can&apos;t tell when to stop
            reading.</p>

        <p>Programs in which master processes are trying to do interactive
            things with slaved minilanguages that are not carefully designed
            around this problem are prone to deadlock as the master and slave fall
            out of synchronization (a problem we first noted in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a>).</p>
        <p>There are workarounds for driving minilanguages that are not so
            carefully designed. The prototype for most of them is the
            Tcl</p>
        <p>Workalikes of the <i>expect</i> package in
            other languages are available; a Web search for the name of your
            favorite language with the added keywords &#x201C;Tcl expect&#x201D; is
            quite likely to turn up something useful. As a minilanguage designer,
            however, you would be unwise to assume that all your users will be
