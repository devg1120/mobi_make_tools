    <p>Designing with minilanguages involves two distinct challenges.
        One is having existing minilanguages handy in your toolkit, and
        recognizing when they can be applied as-is. The other is knowing when
        it is appropriate to design a custom minilanguage for an application.
        To help you develop both aspects of your design sense, about half of
        this chapter will consist of case studies.</p>

        <p>In <a href="transparencychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;6.&#xFFFD;Transparency">Chapter&#xFFFD;6</a> we
            looked at
            sng(1),
            which translates between
            PNG</p>
        <p>SNG does, however, share one important characteristic with
            domain-specific minilanguages that binary structured data formats like
            PNG do not &#x2014;

        <p>A kind of specification that turns up repeatedly in Unix tools
            and scripting languages is the <i>regular
                expression</i> (&#x2018;regexp&#x2019; for short). We consider
            it here as a declarative minilanguage for describing text patterns; it
            is often embedded in other minilanguages. Regexps are so ubiquitous
            that the are hardly thought of as a minilanguage, but they replace
            what would otherwise be huge volumes of code implementing different
            (and incompatible) search capabilities.</p>
        <p>This introduction skates over some details like POSIX
            </p>
        <p>Regular expressions describe patterns that may either match or
            fail to match against strings. The simplest regular-expression tool
            is grep(1), a filter that passes through to its output every
            line in its input matching a specified regexp.

        <p>There are a number of minor variants of regexp notation:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">

                <li>
                    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Glob expressions.</em></span> This is the limited set
                        of wildcard conventions used by early Unix shells for filename
                        matching. There are only three wildcards: <tt>*</tt>, which matches any
                        sequence of characters (like <tt>.*</tt> in the other variants); <tt>?</tt>, which
                        matches any single character (like <tt>.</tt> in the other variants); and
                        <tt>[...]</tt>, which matches a character class just as in the other variants.
                        Some shells (<i>csh</i>, <i>bash</i>, <i>zsh</i>) later
                        added <tt>{}</tt> for alternation. Thus, <tt>x{a,b}c</tt> matches <tt>xac</tt> or <tt>xbc</tt> but not
                        <tt>xc</tt>. Some shells further extend globs in the direction of extended
                        regular expressions.</p>

                        also use these. Old Unix hands think of these as the basic or

        <p>Design practice in new languages with regexp support has
            stabilized on the Perl/Python variant. It is more transparent than the
            others, notably because backlash before a non-alphanumeric character
            always means that character as a literal, so there is much
            less confusion about how to quote elements of regexps.</p>
        <p>Regular expressions are an extreme example of how concise a
            minilanguage can be. Simple regular expressions express recognition
            behavior that would otherwise have to be implenented with hundreds of
            lines of fussy, bug-prone code.</p>

        <p><i>Glade</i> is an interface
            builder for the open-source GTK toolkit library for
            X.<sup>[<a id="id2933471" href="ch08s02.html#ftn.id2933471">82</a>]</sup>
            <i>Glade</i> allows you to develop a
            GUI interface by interactively picking, placing, and modifying widgets
            on an interface panel. The GUI editor produces an XML file describing
            the interface; this, in turn, can be fed to one of several code
            generators that will actually grind out C</p>
        <p> <i>Glade</i>&apos;s XML format for
            describing GUIs is a good example of a simple domain-specific
            minilanguage. See <a href="ch08s02.html#glade_example" title="Example&#xFFFD;8.1.&#xFFFD;Glade Hello, World.">Example&#xFFFD;8.1</a> for a &#x201C;Hello,

        <p>A valid specification in <i>Glade</i> format implies a repertoire of actions
            by the GUI in response to user behavior. The
            <i>Glade</i> GUI treats these specifications as
            structured data files; <i>Glade</i> code
            generators, on the other hand, use them to write programs implementing
            a GUI. For some languages (including Python</p>
        <p>Once you get past the verbosity of XML,
            <i>Glade</i> markup is a fairly simple language.
            It does just two things: declare GUI-widget hierarchies and associate
            properties with widgets. You don&apos;t actually have to know a lot about
            how <i>glade</i> works to read the specification
            above. In fact, if you have any experience programming in GUI
            toolkits, reading it will immediately give you a fairly good
            visualization of what <i>glade</i> does with the
            specification. (Hands up everyone who predicted that this particular
            specification will give you a single button widget in a window
            frame.)</p>
        <p>This kind of transparency and simplicity is the mark of a good
            minilanguage
            design</p>
        <p>The ultimate functional test of a minilanguage like this one is
            simple: can I hack it without reading the manual? For a significant
            range of cases, the <i>Glade</i> answer
            is yes. For example, if you know the C-level constants that GTK uses
            to describe window-positioning hints, you&apos;ll recognize <tt>GTK_WIN_POS_NONE</tt> as one and instantly be able to
            change the positioning hint associated with this GUI.</p>
        <p>The advantage of using <i>Glade</i> should be clear. It specializes in
            code generation so you don&apos;t have to. That&apos;s one less routine task
            you have to hand-code, and one fewer source of hand-coded bugs.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The
            m4(1)
            macro processor interprets a declarative minilanguage for describing
            transformations of text. An <i>m4</i> program is
            a set of macros that specifies ways to expand text strings into other
            strings. Applying those declarations to an input text with <i>m4</i>
            performs macro expansion and yields an output text. (The
            C</p>
        <p><a href="ch08s02.html#m4_macro" title="Example&#xFFFD;8.2.&#xFFFD;A sample m4 macro.">Example&#xFFFD;8.2</a> shows an
            <i>m4</i> macro that directs
            <i>m4</i> to expand each occurrence of the string
            &quot;OS&quot; in its input into the string &quot;operating system&quot; on output. This
            is a trivial example; <i>m4</i> supports macros
            with arguments that can be used to do more than transform one fixed
            string into another. Typing <b>info m4</b> at your shell
            prompt will probably display on-line documentation for this
            language.</p>
        <div class="example"><a id="m4_macro">
                <p class="title"><b>Example&#xFFFD;8.2.&#xFFFD;A sample <i>m4</i> macro.</b></p>

define(`OS&apos;, `operating system&apos;)
</pre>
            </a></div>
        <p>The <i>m4</i> macro language supports
            conditionals and recursion. The combination can be used to implement
            loops, and this was intended; <i>m4</i> is
            deliberately Turing-complete. But actually trying to use
            <i>m4</i> as a general-purpose language would be
            deeply perverse.</p>
        <p>The <i>m4</i> macro processor is usually
            employed as a preprocessor for minilanguages that lack a built-in
            notion of named procedures or a built-in file-inclusion feature. It&apos;s
            an easy way to extend the syntax of the base language so the
            combination with <i>m4</i> supports both these
            features.</p>
        <p>One well-known use of <i>m4</i> has been to
            clean up (or at least effectively hide) another minilanguage design
            that was called out as a bad example earlier in this chapter. Most
            system administrators now generate their
            <tt>sendmail.cf</tt> configuration files using an
            <i>m4</i> macro package supplied with the
            <i>sendmail</i> distribution. The macros
            start from feature names (or name/value pairs) and generate the
            corresponding (much uglier) strings in the
            <i>sendmail</i> configuration language.</p>
        <p>Use <i>m4</i> with caution, however. Unix
            experience has taught minilanguage designers to be wary of macro
            expansion,<sup>[<a id="id2934007" href="ch08s02.html#ftn.id2934007">83</a>]</sup> for reasons we&apos;ll discuss <a href="ch08s03.html#macroexpansion" title="Macros &#x2014; Beware!">later in the chapter</a>.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>XSLT, like <i>m4</i> macros, is a
            language for describing transformations of a text stream. But it does
            much more than simple macro substitution; it describes transformations
            of XML data, including query and report generation. It is the
            language used to write XML stylesheets. For practical applications,
            see the description of XML document processing in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;18.&#xFFFD;Documentation">Chapter&#xFFFD;18</a>. XSLT is described by a World Wide
            Web Consortium standard and has several open-source
            implementations.</p>
        <p>XSLT and <i>m4</i> macros are both purely
            declarative and Turing-complete, but XSLT supports only recursions and
            not loops. It is quite complex, certainly the most difficult language
            to master of any in this chapter&apos;s case studies &#x2014; and probably
            the most difficult of any language mentioned in this
            book.<sup>[<a id="id2934079" href="ch08s02.html#ftn.id2934079">84</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>Despite its complexity, XSLT really is a minilanguage. It
            shares important (though not universal) characteristics of the breed:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

                    <p>Restricted interface to the rest of the world. XSLT processors are
                        designed to filter standard input to standard output, with a
                        limited ability to read and write files. They can&apos;t open sockets

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The
            troff(1)
            typesetting formatter was, as we noted in <a href="historychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;2.&#xFFFD;History">Chapter&#xFFFD;2</a>, Unix&apos;s original killer application.
            <i>troff</i> is the center of a suite of
            formatting tools (collectively called Documenter&apos;s Workbench or DWB),
            all of which are domain-specific minilanguages of various kinds. Most
            are either preprocessors or postprocessors for
            troff markup. Open-source Unixes host an
            enhanced implementation of Documenter&apos;s Workbench called
            groff(1),
            from the Free Software Foundation</p>
        <p>We&apos;ll examine <i>troff</i> in more detail in
            <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;18.&#xFFFD;Documentation">Chapter&#xFFFD;18</a>; for now,
            it&apos;s sufficient to note that it is a good example of an imperative
            minilanguage that borders on being a full-fledged interpreter (it has
            conditionals and recursion but not loops; it is accidentally
            Turing-complete).</p>
        <p>The postprocessors (&#x2018;drivers&#x2019; in DWB terminology)
            are normally not visible to <i>troff</i> users.
            The original troff emitted codes for the
            particular typesetter the Unix development group had available in
            1970; later in the 1970s these were cleaned up into a
            device-independent minilanguage for placing text and simple graphics
            on a page. The postprocessors translate this language (called
            &#x201C;ditroff&#x201D; for &#x201C;device-independent troff&#x201D;)
            into something modern imaging printers can actually accept &#x2014; the
            most important of these (and the modern default) is PostScript.</p>
        <p>The preprocessors are more interesting, because they actually
            add capabilities to the troff language.
            There are three common ones:
            tbl(1)
            for making tables,
            eqn(1)
            for typesetting mathematical equations, and
            pic(1)
            for drawing diagrams. Less used, but still live, are
            grn(1)
            for graphics, and
            refer(1)
            and
            bib(1)
            for formatting bibliographies. Open-source equivalents of all of these
            ship with <i>groff</i>. The
            grap(1)
            preprocessor provided a rather versatile plotting facility; there is
            an open-source implementation separate from
            <i>groff</i>.</p>
        <p>Some other preprocessors have no open-source implementation and
            are no longer in common use. Best known of these was
            ideal(1),
            for graphics. A younger sibling of the family,
            chem(1),
            draws chemical structural formulas; it is available as part of Bell
            Labs&apos;s netlib code.<sup>[<a id="id2934417" href="ch08s02.html#ftn.id2934417">86</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>Each of these preprocessors is a little program that accepts a
            minilanguage and compiles it into troff requests. Each one recognizes
            the markup it is supposed to interpret by looking for a unique start
            and end request, and passes through unaltered any markup outside those
            (<i>tbl</i> looks for
            .TS/.TE,
            <i>pic</i> looks for
            .PS/.PE, etc.). Thus, most of the
            preprocessors can normally be run in any order without stepping on
            each other. There are some exceptions: in particular,
            <i>chem</i> and <i>grap</i>
            both issue <i>pic</i> commands, and so must come
            before it in the pipeline.</p>

        <p>The preceding is a full-Monty example of a Documenter&apos;s Workbench
            processing pipeline</p>
        <p>The document markup of Documenter&apos;s Workbench is in some ways
            obsolete, but the range of problems these preprocessors address gives
            some indication of the power of the minilanguage model &#x2014; it
            would be extremely difficult to embed equivalent knowledge into a
            WYSIWYG word processor. There are some ways in which modern XML-based
            document markups and toolchains are still, in 2003, playing
            catch-up with capabilities that Documenter&apos;s Workbench had in 1979.
            We&apos;ll discuss these issues in more detail in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;18.&#xFFFD;Documentation">Chapter&#xFFFD;18</a>.</p>
        <p>The design themes that gave Documenter&apos;s Workbench so much power
            should by now be familiar ones; all the tools share a common
            text-stream representation of documents, and the formatting system is
            broken up into independent components that can be debugged and
            improved separately. The pipeline architecture supports plugging in
            new, experimental preprocessors and postprocessors without disturbing
            old ones. It is modular and extensible.</p>
        <p>The architecture of Documenter&apos;s Workbench as a whole teaches us
            some things about how to fit multiple specialist minilanguages into a
            cooperating system. One preprocessor can build on another. Indeed,
            the Documenter&apos;s Workbench tools were an early exemplar of the power
            of pipes, filtering, and minilanguages that influenced a lot of later
            Unix design by example. The design of the individual preprocessors
            has more lessons to teach about what effective minilanguage designs
            look like.</p>
        <p>One of these lessons is negative. Sometimes users writing
            descriptions in the minilanguages do unclean things with low-level
            troff markup inserted by hand. This can
            produce interactions and bugs that are hard to diagnose, because the
            generated troff coming out of the pipeline
            is not visible &#x2014; and would not be readable if it were. This is
            analogous to the sorts of bugs that happen in code that mixes C with
            snippets of in-line assembler. It might have been better to separate
            the language layers more completely, if that were possible.
            Minilanguage designers should take note of this.</p>
        <p>All the preprocessor languages (though not troff markup itself)
            have relatively clean, shell-like syntaxes that follow many of the
            conventions we described in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a> for the design of data-file formats.
            There are a few embarrassing exceptions; notably,
            tbl(1)
            defaults to using a tab as a field separator between table columns,
            replicating an infamous botch in the design of
            make(1)
            and causing annoying bugs when editors or other tools invisibly change
            the composition of whitespace.</p>
        <p>While troff itself is a specialized
            imperative language, one theme that runs through at least three of the
            Documenter&apos;s Workbench minilanguages is declarative semantics: doing
            layout from constraints. This is an idea that shows up in modern GUI
            toolkits as well &#x2014; that, instead of giving pixel coordinates for
            graphical objects, what you really want to do is declare spatial
            relationships among them (&#x201C;widget A is above widget B, which is
            to the left of widget C&#x201D;) and have your software compute a
            best-fit layout for A, B, and C according to those constraints.</p>
        <p>The
            pic(1)
            program uses this approach to lay out elements for diagrams. The

        <p>This is a very typical Unix minilanguage design, and as such has
            some points of interest even on the purely syntactic level. Notice
            how much it looks like a shell program: # leads comments, and
            the syntax is obviously token-oriented with the simplest possible
            convention for strings. The designer of
            pic(1)
            knew that Unix programmers expect minilanguage syntaxes to look like
            this unless there is a strong and specific reason they should not.
            The Rule of Least Surprise is in full operation here.</p>
        <p>It probably doesn&apos;t take a lot of effort to discern that the
            first line of code is a macro definition; the later references to
            <tt>smallellipse()</tt> encapsulate a repeated design
            element of the diagram. Nor will it take much scrutiny to deduce that
            <tt>box invis</tt> declares a box with invisible borders,
            actually just a frame for text to be stacked inside. The
            <tt>arrow</tt> command is equally obvious.</p>
        <p>With these as clues and one eye on the actual diagram, the
            meaning of the remaining pieces of the syntax (position references
            like <tt>M.s</tt> and constructions like
            <tt>last arrow</tt> or <tt>at
                0.25 between M.e and I.e</tt> or the addition of vector offsets
            to a location) should become rapidly apparent. As with
            Glade markup and <i>m4</i>, an
            example like this one can teach a good bit of the language without any
            reference to a manual (a compactness property
            troff(1)
            markup, unfortunately, does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have).</p>
        <p>The example of
            pic(1)
            reflects a common design theme in minilanguages, which we also
            saw reflected in Glade &#x2014; the use of a
            minilanguage interpreter to encapsulate some form of constraint-based
            reasoning and turn it into actions. We could actually choose to view
            pic(1)
            as an imperative language rather than a declarative one; it has
            elements of both, and the dispute would quickly grow
            theological.</p>
        <p>The combination of macros with constraint-based layout gives
            pic(1)
            the ability to express the structure of diagrams in a way that more
            modern vector-based markups like SVG cannot. It is therefore
            fortunate that one effect of the Documenter&apos;s Workbench design is to
            make it relatively easy to keep
            pic(1)
            useful outside the DWB context. The <i>pic2graph</i> script we used as a case study in
            <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a> was an
            ad-hoc way to accomplish this, using the retrofitted PostScript
            capability of
            groff(1)
            as a half-way step to a modern bitmap format.</p>
        <p>A cleaner solution is the
            pic2plot(1)
            utility distributed with the GNU plotutils
            package</p>

        </div>
        <p>The <i>awk</i> minilanguage is an old-school
            Unix tool, formerly much used in shellscripts. Like
            <i>m4</i>, it&apos;s intended for writing small but
            expressive programs to transform textual input into textual output.
            Versions ship with all Unixes, several in open source; the command
            <b>info gawk</b> at your Unix shell prompt is quite likely
            to take you to on-line documentation.</p>
        <p>Programs in <i>awk</i> consist of
            pattern/action pairs. Each pattern is a <i>regular
                expression</i>, a concept we&apos;ll describe in detail in <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;9.&#xFFFD;Generation">Chapter&#xFFFD;9</a>. When an <i>awk</i>
            program is run, it steps through each line of the input file. Each
            line is checked against every pattern/action pair in order. If the
            pattern matches the line, the associated action is performed.</p>
        <p>Each action is coded in a language resembling a subset of C, with
            variables and conditionals and loops and an ontology of types
            including integers, strings, and (unlike C)
            dictionaries.<sup>[<a id="id2935337" href="ch08s02.html#ftn.id2935337">89</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>The <i>awk</i> action language is
            Turing-complete, and can read and write files. In some versions it can
            open and use network sockets. But <i>awk</i> has
            primarily seen use as a report generator, especially for interpreting
            and reducing tabular data. It is seldom used standalone, but rather
            embedded in scripts. There is an example
            <i>awk</i> program in the <a href="ch09s02.html#htmlgen" title="Case Study: Generating HTML Code for a Tabular List">case study on HTML generation</a> included in
            <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;9.&#xFFFD;Generation">Chapter&#xFFFD;9</a>.</p>
        <p>A case study of <i>awk</i> is included to
            point out that it is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a model for emulation;
            in fact, since 1990 it has largely fallen out of use. It has been
            superseded by new-school scripting
            languages</p>
        <p>The <i>awk</i> language was originally
            designed to be a small, expressive special-purpose language for report
            generation. Unfortunately, it turns out to have been designed at a
            bad spot on the complexity-vs.-power curve. The action language is
            noncompact</p>

        <p>For a few years after the release of Perl in 1987,
            <i>awk</i> remained competitive simply because it
            had a smaller, faster implementation. But as the cost of compute
            cycles and memory dropped, the economic reasons for favoring a
            special-purpose language that was relatively thrifty with both lost
            their force. Programmers increasingly chose to do awklike things with
            Perl or (later) Python, rather than keep two different scripting
            languages</p>
        <p>Falling costs have changed the tradeoffs in minilanguage design.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>PostScript is a minilanguage specialized for describing typeset
            text and graphics to imaging devices. It is an import into Unix,
            based on design work done at the legendary Xerox Palo Alto
            Research Center</p>
        <p>PostScript bears some functional resemblance to troff markup;
            both are intended to control printers and other imaging devices, and
            both are normally generated by programs or macro packages rather than
            being hand-written by humans. But where troff requests are a
            jumped-up set of format-control codes with some language features
            tacked on as an afterthought, PostScript was designed from the ground
            up as a language and is far more expressive and powerful. The main
            thing that makes Postscript useful is that algorithmic descriptions of
            images written in it are far smaller than the bitmaps they render to,
            and so take up less storage and communication bandwidth.</p>
        <p>PostScript is explicitly Turing-complete, supporting
            conditionals and loops and recursion and named procedures. The
            ontology of types includes integers, reals, strings, and arrays (each
            element of an array may be of any type) but no equivalent of
            structures. Technically, PostScript is a stack-based language;
            arguments of PostScript&apos;s primitive procedures (operators) are normally
            popped off a push-down stack of arguments, and the result(s) are pushed
            back onto it.</p>
        <p>There are about 40 basic operators out of a total of around 400.
            The one that does most of the work is <b>show</b>, which
            draws a string onto the page. Others set the current font, change the
            gray level or color, draw lines or arcs or Bezier curves, fill closed
            regions, set clipping regions, etc. A PostScript interpreter is
            supposed to be able to interpret these commands into bitmaps to be
            thrown on a display or print medium.</p>
        <p>Other PostScript operators implement arithmetic, control
            structures, and procedures. These allow repetitive or stereotyped
            images (such as text, which is composed of repeated letterforms) to be
            expressed as programs that combine images. Part of the utility of
            PostScript comes from the fact that PostScript programs to print text or
            simple vector graphics are much less bulky than the bitmaps the text
            or vectors render to, are device-resolution independent, and travel more
            quickly over a network cable or serial line.</p>
        <p>Historically, PostScript&apos;s stack-based interpretation resembles
            a language called FORTH, originally designed to control telescope
            motors in real time, which was briefly popular in the 1980s.
            Stack-based languages are famous for supporting extremely tight,
            economical coding and infamous for being difficult to read.
            PostScript shares both traits.</p>
        <p>PostScript is often implemented as firmware built into a
            printer. The open-source implementation Ghostscript can translate
            PostScript to various graphics formats and (weaker) printer-control
            languages. Most other software treats PostScript as a final output
            format, meant to be handed to a PostScript-capable imaging device but
            not edited or eyeballed.</p>

        <p>The domain of these two languages is unlimited-precision
            arithmetic. Other programs can use them to do such calculations
            without having to worry about the special techniques needed to do
            those calculations.</p>

                            been done with a simple floating-point program. The motivation was

        <p>Like SNG and <i>Glade</i> markup, one of the
            strengths of both of these languages is their simplicity. Once you
            know that
            dc(1)
            is a reverse-Polish-notation calculator and
            bc(1)
            an algebraic-notation calculator, very little about interactive use of
            either of these languages is going to be novel. We&apos;ll return to the
            importance of the Rule of Least Surprise in interfaces in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a>.</p>
        <p>These minilanguages have both conditionals and loops; they are
            Turing-complete, but have a very restricted ontology of types
            including only unlimited-precision integers and strings. This puts
            them in the borderland between interpreted minilanguages and full
            scripting languages</p>
        <p>Normally,
            <i>dc</i>/<i>bc</i> are used
            conversationally, but their capacity to support libraries of
            user-defined procedures gives them an additional kind of utility
            &#x2014; programmability. This is actually the most important advantage
            of imperative minilanguages, one that we observed in the case study
            of the Documenter&apos;s Workbench tools to be very powerful whether or not
            a program&apos;s normal mode is conversational; you can use them to write
            high-level programs that embody task-specific intelligence.</p>
        <p>Because the interface of
            <i>dc</i>/<i>bc</i> is so
            simple (send a line containing an expression, get back a line
            containing a value) other programs and scripts can easily get access
            to all these capabilities by calling these programs as slave
            processes. <a href="ch08s02.html#rsa" title="Example&#xFFFD;8.6.&#xFFFD;RSA implementation using dc.">Example&#xFFFD;8.6</a> is one famous example, an implementation of the
