    <p>The future of Unix is full of difficult problems. Would we
        truly want it any other way?</p>
    <p>For more than thirty years we have thrived on challenges. We
        pioneered the best practices of software engineering. We created
        today&apos;s Internet and Web. We have built the largest, most complex,
        and most reliable software systems ever to exist. We outlasted the
        IBM</p>
    <p>Not that everything has been triumph by any means. In the 1980s
        we nearly destroyed ourselves by acceding to the proprietary capture
        of Unix. We neglected the low end, the nontechnical end users, for
        far too long and thereby left
        Microsoft</p>
    <p>But always we have come storming back. We make mistakes, but we
        learn from our mistakes. We have transmitted our culture across
        generations; we have absorbed much of what was best from the early
        academic hackers</p>
    <p>So far, betting against the Unix hackers has always been
        short-term smart but long-term stupid. We can prevail &#x2014; if we
        choose to.</p>
