    <p>Unix predates the modern graphics-intensive style of software
        interface design. For over a decade after the first Unix in 1969,
        command-line interfaces (CLIs) on teletypes and dumb text-mode
        terminals were the norm. Most of the basic Unix toolset (programs like
        ls(1),
        cat(1),
        and
        grep(1))
        still reflect this heritage.</p>
    <p>Gradually, after 1980, Unix evolved support for screen-painting
        on character-cell terminals. Programs began to mix command-line and
        visual interfaces, with common commands often bound to keystrokes that
        would not be echoed to the screen. Some of the early programs written
        in this style (often called &#x2018;curses&#x2019; programs, after the
        screen-painting cursor-control library normally used to implement
        them, or &#x2018;roguelike&#x2019; after the first application to use
        curses) are still used today; notable examples include the
        dungeon-crawling game
        rogue(1),
        the
        vi(1)</p>
    <p>A few years later in the mid-1980s, the computing world as a
        whole began to assimilate the results of the pioneering work on
        graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that had been going on at Xerox&apos;s
        Palo Alto Research Center since the early 1970s. On personal
        computers, the Xerox PARC</p>
    <p>Around 1987 the X windowing system</p>
    <p>The designers of X decided early on that X would support
        &#x201C;mechanism, not policy&#x201D;. Their objective was to make X as
        flexible and portable across platforms as possible, while putting as
        few constraints on the look and feel of X programs as they could
        manage. Look and feel, they decided, would be handled by
        &#x2018;toolkits&#x2019; &#x2014; libraries calling X services linked to
        user programs. X would also be designed to support multiple window
        managers,<sup>[<a id="id2951032" href="ch11s02.html#ftn.id2951032">106</a>]</sup> and would not require a
        window manager to have any special privileges or uniquely close
        integration with X&apos;s machinery.</p>
    <p>This approach was the polar opposite of that taken by the
        Macintosh and Windows commercial products, which enforced
        particular look-and-feel policies by designing them right into the
        system. The difference in approach ensured that X would have a
        long-run evolutionary advantage by remaining adaptable as new
        discoveries were made about the human factors in interface design
        &#x2014; but it also ensured that the X world would be divided by
        multiple toolkits, a profusion of window managers, and many
        experiments in look and feel.</p>
    <p>Since the mid-1990s X has become ubiquitous even on the
        lowest-end personal Unix machines. Use of Unix from text-mode
        terminals, as opposed to graphics-capable computer consoles, has
        sharply declined and seems headed for extinction. Accordingly, the
        use of curses-style interfaces for new applications is also in
        decline; most new applications that would formerly have been
        designed in that style now use an X toolkit. It is instructive to
        note that Unix&apos;s older CLI design tradition is still
        quite vigorous and successfully competes with X in many areas.</p>
    <p>It is also instructive to note that there are a few
        specific application areas in which curses-style (or
        &#x2018;roguelike&#x2019;) character-cell interfaces remain the norm
        &#x2014; especially text editors and interactive communications
        programs such as mailers, newsreaders, and chat clients.</p>
    <p>For historical reasons, then, there is a wide range of
        interface styles in Unix programs. Line-oriented, character-cell
        screen-oriented, and X-based &#x2014; with the X-based world somewhat
        balkanized by the competition between multiple X toolkits and
        window managers (though this is less an issue in 2003 than
        was the case five or even three years ago).</p>
