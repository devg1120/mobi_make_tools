    </div>
    <p>A great many major open-source projects are converging on
        DocBook as a standard format for their documentation. The advocates
        of XML-based markup seem to have won the theoretical argument against
        presentation-level and for structural-level markup, and an effective
        XML-DocBook toolchain is available in open source.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, a lot of confusion still surrounds DocBook and the
        programs that support it. Its devotees speak an argot that is dense
        and forbidding even by computer-science standards, slinging around
        acronyms that have no obvious relationship to the things you need to
        do to write markup and make HTML or PostScript from it. XML standards
        and technical papers are notoriously obscure. In the rest of this
        section, we&apos;ll try to dispel the fog of jargon.</p>

        <p>(Note: to keep the explanation simple, most of this section
            tells some lies, mainly by omitting a lot of history. Truthfulness
            will be fully restored in a following section.)</p>
        <p>DocBook is a structural-level markup language. Specifically, it
            is a dialect of XML. A DocBook document is a piece of XML that uses
            XML tags for structural markup.</p>
        <p>For a document formatter to apply a stylesheet to your document
            and make it look good, it needs to know things about the overall
            structure of your document. For example, in order to physically
            format chapter headers properly, it needs to know that a book
            manuscript normally consists of front matter, a sequence of chapters,
            and back matter. In order for it to know this sort of thing, you
            need to give it a <i>Document Type
                Definition</i></p>
        <p>What we mean by calling DocBook a &#x2018;dialect&#x2019; of XML
            is actually that DocBook is a DTD &#x2014; a rather large DTD, with
            somewhere around 400 tags in it.<sup>[<a id="id3006067" href="ch18s05.html#ftn.id3006067">152</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>Lurking behind DocBook is a kind of program called a
            <i>validating parser</i></p>
        <p>The validating parser will either throw an error, giving you messages
            about places where the document structure is broken, or translate the
            document into a stream of XML elements and text that the parser back
            end combines with the information in your stylesheet to produce
            formatted output.</p>
        <p><a href="ch18s05.html#docfig1" title="Figure&#xFFFD;18.1.&#xFFFD;Processing structural documents.">Figure&#xFFFD;18.1</a> diagrams the whole process.</p>

        <p>The part of the diagram inside the dotted box is your formatting
            software, or <i>toolchain</i>. Besides the obvious and
            visible input to the formatter (the document source) you&apos;ll need to
            keep the two hidden inputs of the formatter (DTD and stylesheet) in
            mind to understand what follows.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>A brief digression into other DTDs may help clarify what parts of
            the previous section are specific to DocBook and what parts are general to
            all structural-markup languages.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.tei-c.org/" target="_top">TEI</a> (Text Encoding
            Initiative) is a large, elaborate DTD used primarily in academia for
            computer transcription of literary texts. TEI&apos;s Unix-based toolchains
            use many of the same tools that are involved with DocBook, but with
            different stylesheets and (of course) a different DTD.</p>
        <p>XHTML, the latest version of HTML, is also an XML application
            described by a DTD, which explains the family resemblance between
            XHTML and DocBook tags. The XHTML toolchain consists of Web browsers
            that can format HTML as flat ASCII, together with any of a number of
            ad-hoc HTML-to-print utilities.</p>
        <p>Many other XML DTDs are maintained to help people exchange
            structured information in fields as diverse as bioinformatics and
            banking. You can look at a <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/rg/DTD_Repositories" target="_top">list of
                repositories</a> to get some idea of the variety available.</p>

        <p>The second biggest problem with DocBook is the effort needed to
            convert old-style presentation markup to DocBook markup. Human beings
            can usually parse the presentation of a document into logical
            structure automatically, because (for example) they can tell from
            context when an italic font means &#x2018;emphasis&#x2019; and when it means
            something else such as &#x2018;this is a foreign phrase&#x2019;.</p>
        <p>Somehow, in converting documents to DocBook, those
            sorts of distinctions need to be made explicit. Sometimes
            they&apos;re present in the old markup; often they are not, and the
            missing structural information has to be either deduced by
            clever heuristics or added by a human.</p>
        <p>Here is a summary of the state of conversion tools from
            various other formats. None of these do a completely perfect job;
            inspection and perhaps a bit of hand-editing by a human being
            will be needed after conversion.</p>

                    <p>These are generally considered the biggest and nastiest conversion
                        problems. And indeed, the basic
                        troff(1) markup is at too low a presentation
                        level for automatic conversion tools to do much of any good. However,
                        the gloom in the picture lightens significantly if we consider
                        translation from sources of documents written in macro packages like
                        man(7). These have enough structural
                        features for automatic translation to get some traction.</p>
                    <p>I wrote a tool to do troff-to-DocBook
                        myself, because I couldn&apos;t find anything else that did a tolerable
                        job of it. It&apos;s called <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/doclifter/" target="_top">doclifter</a>. It
                        will translate to either SGML or XML DocBook from
                        man(7),
                        mdoc(7),
                        ms(7), or
                        me(7) macros. See the documentation

            that uses <i>LaTeX</i> for printing and supports structural editing of <i>LaTeX</i>

            <a href="http://bgu.chez.tiscali.fr/doc/db4lyx/" target="_top">how-to document</a>
            describing how to write SGML and XML in the LyX GUI.</p>

                <i>TeX</i>Macs</a> is a project aimed at producing an editor that is good
            for technical and mathematical material, including displayed formulas.
            1.0 was released in April 2002. The developers plan XML support in
            the future, but it&apos;s not there yet.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The tools are coming together, if slowly, to edit and format
            DocBook markup. But DocBook itself is a means, not an end. We&apos;ll need
            other standards besides DocBook itself to accomplish the
            searchable-documentation-database objective. There are two big issues:
            document cataloging and metadata.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ScrollKeeper</a>
            project aims directly to meet this need. It provides a simple set of
            script hooks that can be used by package install and uninstall
            productions to register and unregister their documentation.</p>
        <p>ScrollKeeper uses the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/osrt/omf/" target="_top">Open Metadata Format</a>.
            This is a standard for indexing open-source documentation analogous to
            a library card-catalog system. The idea is to support rich search
            facilities that use the card-catalog metadata as well as the source
            text of the documentation itself.</p>

        <p>In previous sections, we have deliberately omitted a lot of

            complete without a long excursion into SGML, the differences between
            SGML and XML, and detailed descriptions of the SGML DocBook toolchain.
            Life can be simpler now; an XML DocBook toolchain is available in open
            source, works as well as the SGML toolchain ever did, and is easier to
            use.</p>
