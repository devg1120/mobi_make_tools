    <p>These philosophical principles aren&apos;t just vague generalities.
        In the Unix world they come straight from experience and lead to
        specific prescriptions, some of which we&apos;ve already developed
        above. Here&apos;s a by no means exhaustive list:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>Everything that can be a source- and
                    destination-independent filter <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be
                    one.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Data streams should if at all possible be textual (so they can
                    be viewed and filtered with standard tools).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Database layouts and application protocols should if
                    at all possible be textual (human-readable and
                    human-editable).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complex front ends (user interfaces) should be cleanly
                    separated from complex back ends.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Whenever possible, prototype in an interpreted language before
                    coding C.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mixing languages is better than writing everything in
                    one, if and only if using only that one is likely to overcomplicate
                    the program.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Be generous in what you accept, rigorous in what you
                    emit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When filtering, never throw away information you don&apos;t
                    need to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Small is beautiful. Write programs that do as little
                    as is consistent with getting the job done.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>We&apos;ll see the Unix design rules, and the prescriptions that
        derive from them, applied over and over again in the remainder of this
        book. Unsurprisingly, they tend to converge with the very best
        practices from software engineering in other
        traditions.<sup>[<a id="id2879339" href="ch01s08.html#ftn.id2879339">12</a>]</sup></p>

            <p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2879339" href="ch01s08.html#id2879339">12</a>] </sup>One notable example is Butler Lampson&apos;s
                <i>Hints for Computer System Design</i> [<a href="apb.html#Lampson" title="[Lampson]">Lampson</a>], which I discovered late in the preparation of
                this book. It not only expresses a number of Unix dicta in forms that
                were clearly discovered independently, but uses many of the same tag
                lines to illustrate them.</p>
