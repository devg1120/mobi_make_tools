    <p>Normal practice in this book has been to intersperse case studies with
        philosophy. But in this chapter we&apos;ll begin by looking at several
        Unix designs that exhibit transparency and discoverability, and
        attempt to draw lessons from them only after all have been
        presented. Each major point of the analysis in the latter half of this
        chapter draws on several of these, and the arrangement avoids forward
        references to case studies the reader hasn&apos;t seen yet.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>First, we&apos;ll look at an example of transparency in UI design. It
            is <i>audacity</i>, an open-source editor for
            sound files that runs on Unix systems, Mac OS X, and Windows.
            Sources, downloadable binaries, documentation, and screen shots are
            available at the <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">project site</a>.</p>
        <p>This program supports cutting, pasting, and editing of audio
            samples. It supports multitrack editing and mixing. The UI is
            superbly simple; the sound waveforms are shown in the
            <i>audacity</i> window. The image of the
            waveform can be cut and pasted; operations on that image are directly
            reflected in the audio sample as soon as they are performed.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a id="id2909476">
                <p class="title"><b>Figure&#xFFFD;6.1.&#xFFFD;Screen shot of <i>audacity</i>.</b></p>

            </a></div>
        <p>Multitrack editing is supported in the simplest possible way;
            the screen splits into multiple per-track displays in a spatial
            relationship that conveys their concurrency and makes it easy to
            match features by inspection. Tracks can be dragged right or
            left with the mouse to change their relative timing.</p>
        <p>Several features of this UI are subtly excellent and worthy of
            emulation: the large, easily visible and clickable operation
            buttons with distinguishing colors, the presence of an undo command
            that removes most of the risk from experimentation, the volume slider
            that makes softness/loudness visually obvious in its shape.</p>
        <p>But these are details. The central virtue of this program is
            that it has a superbly transparent and natural user interface, one that
            erects as few barriers between the user and the sound file as
            possible.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>GCC, the GNU C compiler used on most modern Unixes, is perhaps
            an even better example of engineering for transparency. GCC is
            organized as a sequence of processing stages knit together by a
            driver program. The stages are: preprocessor, parser, code
            generator, assembler, and linker.</p>
        <p>Each of the first three stages takes in a readable textual
            format and emits a readable textual format (the assembler has to emit
            and the linker to accept binary formats, pretty much by definition).
            With various command-line options of the
            gcc(1)
            driver, you can see not just the results after C preprocessing, after
            assembly generation, and after object code generation &#x2014; but you
            can also monitor the results of many intermediate steps in parsing and
            code generation.</p>

        <p>There are many benefits of this organization. One that is
            particularly important for GCC is regression
            testing.<sup>[<a id="id2909913" href="ch06s01.html#ftn.id2909913">60</a>]</sup> Because most
            of the various intermediate formats are textual, deviations from
            expected results in a regression test are easily spotted and analyzed
            using simple textual diff operations on the intermediate results;
            there is no need for specialist dump-analysis tools that may well
            harbor their own bugs, and in any case would represent an additional
            maintenance burden.</p>
        <p>The design pattern to extract from this example is that the
            driver program has monitoring switches that merely (but sufficiently)
            expose the textual data flows among the components. As with
            <i>fetchmail&apos;s</i> <tt>-v</tt> option,
            these options are not afterthoughts; they are designed in for
            discoverability.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><i>kmail</i> is the GUI mailreader
            distributed with the KDE environment. The
            <i>kmail</i> UI is tastefully and well designed,
            with many good features including automatic display of enclosed images
            in a MIME</p>
        <p>Many mail user agents make one gesture in the direction of
            discoverability</p>
        <p>A running <i>kmail</i> displays status
            notifications in a one-line subwindow at the bottom of its window, in
            small type over a steel-gray background clearly modeled on the
            Netscape/Mozilla status bar. When you open a mailbox, for example,
            the status bar displays counts of total and unread messages. The
            visual presentation is unobtrusive; it is easy to ignore the
            notifications, but also easy to focus on them if you want to.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a id="id2910036">
                <p class="title"><b>Figure&#xFFFD;6.2.&#xFFFD;Screen shot of <i>kmail</i>.</b></p>

            </a></div>
        <p>The <i>kmail</i> GUI is good user-interface
            design. It&apos;s informative, but not distracting; it gets around the
            reason we adduce in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a> that the best policy for Unix tools
            operating normally is usually silence. The authors showed excellent
            taste in borrowing the look and feel of the browser status bar.</p>
        <p>But the extent of the <i>kmail</i>
            developers&apos; tastefulness will not become clear until you have to
            troubleshoot an installation that is having trouble sending mail. If
            you watch closely during the send, you will observe that each line of
            the SMTP transaction with the remote mail transport is echoed into the
            <i>kmail</i> status bar as it happens.</p>
        <p>The <i>kmail</i> developers neatly avoid a
            trap that often makes GUI programs like
            <i>kmail</i> a terrible pain in a troubleshooter&apos;s
            fundament. Most design teams with kmail&apos;s objectives would have
            suppressed those messages entirely, fearing that they would give Aunt
            Tillie a touch of the vapors that would drive her back to the
            meretricious pseudo-simplicity of a Windows box.</p>
        <p>Instead, they designed for transparency &#x2014; they made the
            transaction messages show, but also made them visually easy to ignore.
            By getting the presentation right, they managed to please both Aunt
            Tillie and her geeky nephew Melvin who fixes her computer problems.
            This was brilliant; it&apos;s a technique other GUI interfaces could and
            should emulate.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, of course, the visibility of those messages is good
            for Aunt Tillie, because they mean Melvin is far less likely to throw
            up his hands in frustration while trying to solve her email
            problems.</p>
        <p>The lesson here is clear. Dumbing down your UI is only the
            half-smart thing to do. The really smart thing is to find a way
            to leave the details accessible, but make them unobtrusive.</p>

        <p>The point of this tool is to enable users to edit various

        <p>The gains here go beyond the time not spent writing
            special-purpose code for manipulating binary PNGs, however. The code
            of the <i>sng</i> program itself is not especially
            transparent, but it promotes transparency in larger systems of

                <h3 class="title"><a id="id2910334">Case Study: The Terminfo Database</a></h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The terminfo database is a collection of descriptions of
            video-display terminals. Each entry describes the escape sequences
            that perform various manipulations on the terminal screen, such as
            inserting or deleting lines, erasing from the cursor position to end
            of line or screen, or beginning and ending screen highlights such
            as reverse video, underline, or blink.</p>
        <p>The terminfo database is primarily used by the
            curses(3)
            libraries. These underlie the &#x201C;roguelike&#x201D; interface
            style we discuss in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a>, and some very widely used programs such
            as
            mutt(1),
            lynx(1),
            and
            slrn(1).
            Though the terminal emulators such as
            xterm(1)
            that run on today&apos;s bitmapped displays all have capabilities that are
            minor variations on those of the ANSI X3.64 standard and the venerable
            VT100 terminal, there is still enough variation that hardwiring ANSI
            capabilities into applications would be a bad idea. Terminfo is also
            worth studying because problems that are logically similar to the one
            it addressed arise constantly in managing other kinds of peripheral
            hardware that doesn&apos;t have a standard way to report their own
            capabilities.</p>
        <p>The design of terminfo benefits from experience with an earlier
            capability format called termcap. The database of termcap
            descriptions lived in a textual format in one big file,
            <tt>/etc/termcap</tt>; though this format is
            now obsolete, your Unix system almost certainly includes a
            copy.</p>
        <p>Normally, the key used to look up your terminal type entry is
            the environment variable <tt>TERM</tt>, which for purposes of
            this case study is set by magic.<sup>[<a id="id2910448" href="ch06s01.html#ftn.id2910448">61</a>]</sup> Applications that
            use terminfo (or termcap) pay a small penalty in startup lag; when the
            curses(3)
            library initializes itself, it has to look up the entry corresponding
            to <tt>TERM</tt> and load the entry into memory.</p>
        <p>Experience with termcap showed that the startup penalty was
            dominated by the time required to parse the textual representation of
            capabilities. Accordingly, terminfo entries are binary structure dumps
            that can be marshaled and unmarshaled more quickly. There is a master
            textual format for the entire database, the terminfo capability file.
            That file (or individual entries) can be compiled to binary form with
            the terminfo compiler
            tic(1);
            binary entries can be decompiled to the editable text format by
            infocmp(1).</p>
        <p>The design superficially contradicts the advice we gave in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a> against binary
            caches, but this is actually the extreme case in which that&apos;s a good
            tactic. Edits to the text masters are very rare &#x2014; in fact,
            Unixes normally ship with the terminfo database precompiled and the
            text master serving primarily as documentation. Thus, the
            synchronization and inconsistency problems that would normally
            militate against this approach almost never arise.</p>
        <p>The designers of terminfo could have optimized for speed
            in a second way. The entire database of binary entries could have
            been put in some kind of big opaque database file. What they actually did
            instead was more clever and more in the Unix spirit. Terminfo entries
            live in a directory hierarchy, usually on modern Unixes under
            <tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>. Consult the
            terminfo(5)
            man page to find the location on your system.</p>
        <p>If you look in the terminfo directory, you&apos;ll see subdirectories
            named by single printable characters. Under each of these are the
            entries for each terminal type that has a name beginning with that
            letter. The goal of this organization was to avoid having to do a
            linear search of a very large directory; under more modern Unix
            file systems, which represent directories with B-trees or other
            structures optimized for fast lookup, the subdirectories won&apos;t be
            necessary.</p>

                        <p>I found that even on a fairly modern Unix, splitting a big directory up
                            into subdirectories can improve performance substantially. It was tens
                            of thousands of files, an authorized-user database for a big educational
                            institution, on a late-model DEC Alpha running DEC&apos;s Unix. (Subdirectories
                            named by first and last letter of name &#x2014; e.g., &quot;johnson&quot; would be in
                            directory &quot;j_n&quot; &#x2014; worked best of the schemes we tested. Using the first

                            systematically-generated names which differed only toward the end.)
                            This may just say that sophisticated directory indexing is still not as
                            common as it should be... but even so, that makes an organization which
                            works well without it more portable than one which requires it.</p>

        <p>Thus, the cost of opening a terminfo entry is two file system
            lookups and a file open. But since mining the same entry from one
            big database would have required a lookup and open for the database,
            the incremental cost for terminfo&apos;s organization is at most one
            file system lookup. Actually, it&apos;s less than that; it&apos;s the cost
            difference between one file system lookup and whatever retrieval method
            the one big database would have used. This is probably marginal, and
            quite tolerable once per application at startup time.</p>
        <p>Terminfo uses the file system itself as a simple hierarchical
            database. This is a superb bit of constructive laziness, obeying the
            Rule of Economy and the Rule of Transparency. It means that all the
            ordinary tools for navigating, examining and modifying the file system
            can be used to navigate, examine, and modify the terminfo database; no
            special ones (other than
            tic(1)
            and
            infocmp(1)
            for packing and unpacking the individual records) need to be written
            and debugged. It also means that work on speeding up database access
            would be work on speeding up the file system itself, tuning that would
            benefit many more applications than just users of
            curses(3).</p>
        <p>There is one additional advantage of this organization that
            doesn&apos;t come up in the terminfo case; you get to use Unix&apos;s
            permissions mechanism rather than having to invent your own
            access-control layer with its own bugs. This falls out as a
            consequence of adopting the &#x201C;everything is a file&#x201D;
            philosophy of Unix rather than trying to fight it.</p>
        <p>The terminfo directory layout is rather space-inefficient
            on most Unix file systems. The entries are usually between 400 and
            1400 bytes long, but file systems normally allocate a minimum of 4K
            for every nonempty disk file. The designers accepted this cost
            for the same reason they chose a packed binary format, to
            cut the startup latency of terminfo-using programs to a minimum. Disk
            capacity for constant price has exploded over a thousandfold since,
            tending to vindicate that decision.</p>
        <p>The contrast with the formats used by the Microsoft Windows
            </p>
        <p>Using the Unix file system as a database is a tactic other
            applications with simple database requirements might do well to emulate.
            Good reasons not to do it are more likely to have to do with the
            database keys not naturally looking like filenames than they are with
            any performance problems. In any case, it&apos;s the sort of good fast
            hack that can be very useful in prototyping.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Freeciv is an open-source strategy game inspired by Sid Meier&apos;s
            classic <i>Civilization&#xFFFD;II</i>. In it, each player
            begins with a wandering band of neolithic nomads and builds a
            civilization. Player civilizations may explore and colonize the world,
            fight wars, engage in trade, and research technological advances.
            Some players may actually be artificial intelligences; solitaire play
            against these can be challenging. One wins either by conquering the
            world or by being the first player to reach a technology level sufficient
            to get a starship to Alpha Centauri. Sources and documentation are
            available at the <a href="http://www.freeciv.org/" target="_top">project
                site</a>.</p>

        <p>In <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a>
            we&apos;ll exhibit the Freeciv strategy game as an example of client-server
            partitioning, with the server maintaining shared state and the client
            concentrating on GUI presentation. But this game has another notable
            architectural feature; much of the game&apos;s fixed data, rather than
            being wired into the server code, is expressed in a property registry
            read in by the game server at startup time.</p>
        <p>The game&apos;s registry files are written in a textual data-file
            format that assembles text strings (with associated text and numeric
            properties) into various internal lists of important data (such as
            nations and unit types) in the game server. The minilanguage has an
            include directive, so game data can be broken up into semantic units
            (different files) that are each separately editable. This design
            choice has been carried through to such an extent that it&apos;s possible
            to define new nations and new unit types simply by creating new
            declarations in the data files, without touching the server code at
            all.</p>
        <p>The Freeciv server&apos;s startup parsing has an interesting feature
            that creates something of a conflict between two of Unix&apos;s design
            rules, and is therefore worth closer examination. The server ignores
            property names it doesn&apos;t know how to use. This makes it possible to
            declare properties that the server doesn&apos;t yet use without breaking
            the startup parsing. It means that development of the game data
            (policy) and the server engine (mechanism) can be cleanly separated.
            On the other hand, it also means startup parsing won&apos;t catch simple
            misspellings of attribute names. This quiet failure seems to violate
            the Rule of Repair.</p>
        <p>To resolve this conflict, notice that it&apos;s the server&apos;s job to
            <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the registry data, but the task of carefully
            error-checking that data could be handed off to another program to be run
            by human editors each time the registry is modified. One Unix
            solution would be a separate auditing program that analyzes either
            a machine-readable specification of the ruleset format or the source
            of the server code to determine the set of properties it uses, parses
            the Freeciv registry to determine the set of properties it provides,
            and prepares a difference report.<sup>[<a id="id2914267" href="ch06s01.html#ftn.id2914267">62</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>The aggregate of all Freeciv data files is functionally similar
            to a Windows registry, and even uses a syntax resembling the textual
            portions of registries. But the creep and corruption problems we
            noted with the Windows registry don&apos;t crop up here because no program
            (either within or outside the Freeciv suite)
            <span class="emphasis"><em>writes</em></span> to these files. It&apos;s a read-only
            registry edited only by the game&apos;s maintainers.</p>
        <p>The performance impact of data-file parsing is minimized because
            for each file the operation is performed only once, at either
            client or server startup time.</p>
