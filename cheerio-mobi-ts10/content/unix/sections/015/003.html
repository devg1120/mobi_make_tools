    <p>Languages that avoid manual memory management do it by having a
        memory manager built into their runtime executable somewhere.
        Typically, runtime environments in these languages are split into a
        program part (the running script itself) and the interpreter part,
        with the interpreter managing dynamic storage. On Unixes (and other
        modern operating systems) the interpreter core can be shared by
        multiple program parts, reducing the effective overhead for each
        one.</p>

    <p>Advanced shell programming mixes languages freely, employing
        both binaries and interpreted elements from half a dozen or more
        other languages for subtasks. Each language does what it does best,
        each component is a module with narrow interfaces to the others,
        and the global complexity of the whole is much lower than it would
        be had it been coded as a single monster monolith in a general-purpose
        language.</p>
