<h2 id="node">Node</h2>
<p>The basic building block of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). In general a <code>Node</code> represents non-terminals in the language grammar; however, some terminals are kept in the tree such as identifiers and literals.</p>
<p>Two key things make up an AST node's documentation. The node's <code>SyntaxKind</code> which identifies its type within the AST, and its <code>interface</code>, the API the node provides when instantiated into the AST.</p>
<p>Here are a few key <code>interface Node</code> members:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>TextRange</code> members that identify the node's <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> in the source file.</li>
    <li><code>parent?: Node</code> the parent of the node in the AST.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other additional members for <code>Node</code> flags and modifiers etc. that you can lookup by searching <code>interface Node</code> in the source code but the ones we mentioned are vital for node traversal.</p>
<h2 id="sourcefile">SourceFile</h2>
<ul>
    <li><code>SyntaxKind.SourceFile</code></li>
    <li><code>interface SourceFile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each <code>SourceFile</code> is a top-level AST node that is contained in the <code>Program</code>.</p>
