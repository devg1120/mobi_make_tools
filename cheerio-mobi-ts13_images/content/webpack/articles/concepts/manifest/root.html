<h1>The Manifest</h1>
<p>In a typical application or site built with webpack, there are three main types of code:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The source code you, and maybe your team, have written.</li>
    <li>Any third-party library or &quot;vendor&quot; code your source is dependent on.</li>
    <li>A webpack runtime and <strong>manifest</strong> that conducts the interaction of all modules.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will focus on the last of these three parts: the runtime and, in particular, the manifest.</p>
