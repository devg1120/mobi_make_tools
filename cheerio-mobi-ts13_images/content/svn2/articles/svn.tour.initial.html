      <p>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by performing a <em class="firstterm">checkout</em> of
      your project.  Checking out a directory from a repository
      creates a working copy of that directory on your local machine.
      Unless otherwise specified, this copy contains the youngest
      (that is, most recently created or modified) versions of the
      directory and its children found in the Subversion
      repository:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk
A    trunk/README
A    trunk/INSTALL
A    trunk/src/main.c
A    trunk/src/header.h
…
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk
      directory, you can just as easily check out a deeper
      subdirectory of a repository by specifying that subdirectory's
      URL as the checkout URL:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk/src
A    src/main.c
A    src/header.h
A    src/lib/helpers.c
…
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge model instead of
      lock-modify-unlock (see <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.vsn-models" title="Versioning Models">the section called “Versioning Models”</a>),
      you can immediately make changes to the files and directories in
      your working copy.  Your working copy is just like any other
      collection of files and directories on your system.  You can
      edit the files inside it, rename it, even delete the entire
      working copy and forget about it.</p>
      <div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <table border="0" summary="Warning">
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">
              <img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png">
            </td>
            <th align="left">Warning</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>While your working copy is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">just like any other
        collection of files and directories on your system,</span>”</span>
        you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
        about <span class="emphasis"><em>everything else</em></span> that you do.  For
        example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
        copy, you should use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> or
        <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> instead of the copy and move
        commands provided by your operating system.  We'll talk more
        about them later in this chapter.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Unless you're ready to commit the addition of a new file or
      directory or changes to existing ones, there's no need to
      further notify the Subversion server that you've done
      anything.</p>
      <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <p class="title">
                <strong>What Is This .svn Directory?</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The topmost directory of a working copy—and prior to
        version 1.7, every versioned subdirectory
        thereof—contains a special administrative subdirectory
        named <code class="filename">.svn</code>.  Usually, your operating
        system's directory listing commands won't show this
        subdirectory, but it is nevertheless an important directory.
        Whatever you do, don't delete or change anything in the
        administrative area!  Subversion uses that directory and its
        contents to manage your working copy.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Notice that in the previous pair of examples, Subversion
      chose to create a working copy in a directory named for the
      final component of the checkout URL.  This occurs only as a
      convenience to the user when the checkout URL is the only bit of
      information provided to the <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>
      command.  Subversion's command-line client gives you additional
      flexibility, though, allowing you to optionally specify the
      local directory name that Subversion should use for the working
      copy it creates.  For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk my-working-copy
A    my-working-copy/README
A    my-working-copy/INSTALL
A    my-working-copy/src/main.c
A    my-working-copy/src/header.h
…
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If the local directory you specify doesn't yet
      exist, that's okay—<span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> will
      create it for you.</p>
    </div>
