      <p>In CVS, revision numbers are per file.  This is because CVS
      stores its data in RCS files; each file has a corresponding RCS
      file in the repository, and the repository is roughly laid out
      according to the structure of your project tree.</p>
      <p>In Subversion, the repository looks like a single
      filesystem.  Each commit results in an entirely new filesystem
      tree; in essence, the repository is an array of trees.  Each of
      these trees is labeled with a single revision number.  When
      someone talks about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">revision 54</span>”</span>, he's talking
      about a particular tree (and indirectly, the way the filesystem
      looked after the 54th commit).</p>
      <p>Technically, it's not valid to talk about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">revision 5
      of <code class="filename">foo.c</code>.</span>”</span>  Instead, one would say
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in revision
      5.</span>”</span>  Also, be careful when making assumptions about the
      evolution of a file.  In CVS, revisions 5 and 6 of
      <code class="filename">foo.c</code> are always different.  In Subversion,
      it's most likely that <code class="filename">foo.c</code> did
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> change between revisions 5 and
      6.</p>
      <p>Similarly, in CVS, a tag or branch is an annotation on the
      file or on the version information for that individual file,
      whereas in Subversion, a tag or branch is a copy of an entire
      tree (by convention, into the <code class="filename">/branches</code>
      or <code class="filename">/tags</code> directories that appear at the top
      level of the repository, beside <code class="filename">/trunk</code>).  In
      the repository as a whole, many versions of each file may be
      visible: the latest version on each branch, every tagged
      version, and of course the latest version on the trunk
      itself.  So, to refine the terms even further, one would often
      say <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in
      <code class="filename">/branches/REL1</code> in revision
      5.</span>”</span></p>
