      <p>With CVS's pserver, you are required to log in to the server
      (using the <span class="command"><strong>cvs login</strong></span> command) before
      performing any read or write operation—you sometimes even
      have to log in for anonymous operations.  With a Subversion
      repository using Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> or
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as the server, you don't provide any
      authentication credentials at the outset—if an operation
      that you perform requires authentication, the server will
      challenge you for your credentials (whether those credentials
      are username and password, a client certificate, or even both).
      So if your repository is world-readable, you will not be
      required to authenticate at all for read operations.</p>
      <p>As with CVS, Subversion still caches your credentials on
      disk (in your <code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code>
      directory) unless you tell it not to by using the
      <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option.</p>
      <p>The exception to this behavior, however, is in the case of
      accessing an <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server over an SSH
      tunnel, using the <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URL scheme.  In
      that case, the <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> program unconditionally
      demands authentication just to start the tunnel.</p>
