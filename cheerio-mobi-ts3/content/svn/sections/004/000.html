      <p>Theory is useful, but its application is just plain fun.
    Let's move now into the details of using Subversion.  By the time
    you reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to perform all
    the tasks you need to use Subversion in a normal day's work.
    You'll start with getting your files into Subversion, followed by
    an initial checkout of your code.  We'll then walk you through
    making changes and examining those changes.  You'll also see how
    to bring changes made by others into your working copy, examine
    them, and work through any conflicts that might arise.</p>
      <p>This chapter will not provide exhaustive coverage
    of all of Subversion's commands—rather, it's a conversational
    introduction to the most common Subversion tasks that you'll
    encounter.  This chapter assumes that you've read and understood
    <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html" title="Chapter 1. Fundamental Concepts">Chapter 1, <em>Fundamental Concepts</em></a> and are familiar with the general
    model of Subversion.  For a complete reference of all commands,
    see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.html" title="Chapter 9. Subversion Complete Reference">Chapter 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.</p>
      <p>Also, this chapter assumes that the reader is seeking
    information about how to interact in a basic fashion with an
    existing Subversion repository.  No repository means no working
    copy; no working copy means not much of interest in this chapter.
    There are many Internet sites which offer free or inexpensive
    Subversion repository hosting services.  Or, if you'd prefer to
    set up and administer your own repositories, check out
    <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.html" title="Chapter 5. Repository Administration">Chapter 5, <em>Repository Administration</em></a>.  But don't expect the
    examples in this chapter to work without the user having access
    to a Subversion repository.</p>
      <p>Finally, any Subversion operation that contacts the repository
    over a network may potentially require that the user authenticate.
    For the sake of simplicity, our examples throughout this chapter
    avoid demonstrating and discussing authentication.  Be aware that
    if you hope to apply the knowledge herein to an existing,
    real-world Subversion instance, you'll probably be forced to
    provide at least a username and password to the server.  See
    <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.creds" title="Client Credentials">the section called “Client Credentials”</a> for a detailed
    description of Subversion's handling of authentication and client
    credentials.</p>
