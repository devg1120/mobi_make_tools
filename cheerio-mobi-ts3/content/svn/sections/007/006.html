      <p>By now you should have a basic understanding of how to
      create, configure, and maintain Subversion repositories.  We
      introduced you to the various tools that will assist you with
      this task.  Throughout the chapter, we noted common
      administration pitfalls and offered suggestions for avoiding
      them.</p>
      <p>All that remains is for you to decide what exciting data to
      store in your repository, and finally, how to make it available
      over a network.  The next chapter is all about networking.</p>
