      <p>One of Subversion&apos;s greatest features isn&apos;t something you
      get from running its command-line client or other tools.  It&apos;s
      the fact that Subversion was designed modularly and provides a
      stable, public API so that others&#x2014;like yourself,
      perhaps&#x2014;can write custom software that drives Subversion&apos;s
      core logic.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, we took a closer look at Subversion&apos;s
      architecture, examining its logical layers and describing that
      public API, the very same API that Subversion&apos;s own layers use
      to communicate with each other.  Many developers have found
      interesting uses for the Subversion API, from simple repository
      hook scripts, to integrations between Subversion and some other
      application, to completely different version control systems.
