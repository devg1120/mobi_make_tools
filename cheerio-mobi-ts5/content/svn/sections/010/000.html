      <p>Subversion has a modular design: it&apos;s implemented as a
    collection of libraries written in C.  Each library has a
    well-defined purpose and application programming interface (API),
    and that interface is available not only for Subversion itself to
    use, but for any software that wishes to embed or otherwise
    programmatically control Subversion.  Additionally, Subversion&apos;s
    API is available not only to other C programs, but also to
    programs written in higher-level languages such as Python, Perl,
    Java, and Ruby.</p>
      <p>This chapter is for those who wish to interact with Subversion
    through its public API or its various language bindings.  If you
    wish to write robust wrapper scripts around Subversion
    functionality to simplify your own life, are trying to develop
    more complex integrations between Subversion and other pieces of
    software, or just have an interest in Subversion&apos;s various library
    modules and what they offer, this chapter is for you.  If,
    however, you don&apos;t foresee yourself participating with Subversion
    at such a level, feel free to skip this chapter with the
    confidence that your experience as a Subversion user will not be
    affected.</p>
