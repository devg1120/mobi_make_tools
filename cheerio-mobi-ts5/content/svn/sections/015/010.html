      <p>With CVS&apos;s pserver, you are required to log in to the server
      (using the <span class="command"><strong>cvs login</strong></span> command) before
      performing any read or write operation&#x2014;you sometimes even
      have to log in for anonymous operations.  With a Subversion
      repository using Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> or
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as the server, you don&apos;t provide any
      authentication credentials at the outset&#x2014;if an operation
      that you perform requires authentication, the server will
      challenge you for your credentials (whether those credentials
      are username and password, a client certificate, or even both).
      So if your repository is world-readable, you will not be
      required to authenticate at all for read operations.</p>
      <p>As with CVS, Subversion still caches your credentials on
      disk (in your <code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code>
      directory) unless you tell it not to by using the
      <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option.</p>
      <p>The exception to this behavior, however, is in the case of
      accessing an <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server over an SSH
      tunnel, using the <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URL scheme.  In
      that case, the <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> program unconditionally
      demands authentication just to start the tunnel.</p>
