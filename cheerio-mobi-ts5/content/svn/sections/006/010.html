      <p>To branch or not to branch&#x2014;that is an interesting
      question.  This chapter has provided thus far a pretty deep dive
      into the waters of branching and merging, topics which have
      historically been the premier source of Subversion user
      confusion.  As if the rote actions involved in branching and
      branch management aren&apos;t sometimes tricky enough, some users get
      hung up on deciding whether they need to branch at all.  As
      you&apos;ve learned, Subversion can handle common branching and
      branch management scenarios.  So, the decision of whether or not
      to branch a project&apos;s history is rarely a technical one.
      Rather, the social impact of the decision often carries more
      weight.  Let&apos;s examine some of the benefits and costs of using
      branches in a software project.</p>
      <p>The most obvious benefit of working on a branch is
      isolation.  Changes made to the branch don&apos;t affect the other
      lines of development in the project; changes made to those other
      lines don&apos;t affect the branch.  In this way, a branch can serve
      as a great place to experiment with new features, complex bug
      fixes, major code rewrites, and so on.  No matter how much stuff
      Sally breaks on her branch, Harry and the rest of the team can
      continue with their work unhindered outside the branch.</p>
      <p>Branches also provide a great way to organize related
      changes into readily identifiable collections.  For example, the
      changes which comprise the complete solution to a particular bug
      might be a list of non-sequential revision numbers.  You might
      describe them in human language as <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">revisions 1534, 1543,
      1587 and 1588</span>&#x201D;</span>.  You&apos;d probably reproduce those numbers
      manually (or otherwise) in the issue tracker artifact which
      tracks the bug.  When porting the bug fix to other product
      versions, you&apos;d need to make sure to port all those revisions.
      But had those changes been made on a unique branch, you&apos;d find
      yourself referring only to that branch by its name in
      conversation, in issue tracker comments, and when porting
      changes.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate downside of branches, though, is that the
      very isolation that makes them so
      useful <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be at odds with the
      collaborative needs of the project team.  Depending on the work
      habits of your project peers, changes made to branches might not
      get the kind of constructive review, criticism, and testing that
      changes made to the main line of development do.  The isolation
      of a branch can encourage users to forsake certain version
      control <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">best practices</span>&#x201D;</span>, leading to version
      history which is difficult to review <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">post
      facto</em></span>.  Developers on long-lived branches
      sometimes need to work extra hard to ensure that the
      evolutionary direction of their isolated copy of the codebase is
      in harmony with the direction their peers are steering the main
      code lines.  Now, these drawbacks might be less of an issue for
      true exploratory branches aimed at experimenting with the future
      of a codebase with no expectation of reintegrating the results
      back into the main development lines&#x2014;mere policy needn&apos;t
      be a vision-killer!  But the simple fact remains that projects
      generally benefit from an orderly approach to version control
      where code and code changes enjoy the review and comprehension
      of more than one team member.</p>
      <p>That&apos;s not to say that there are no technical penalties to
      branching.  Pardon us while we <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">go meta</span>&#x201D;</span> for a bit
      here.  If you think about it, every time you checkout a
      Subversion working copy, you&apos;re creating a branch of sorts of
      your project.  It&apos;s a special sort of branch.  It lives only on
      your client machine; not in the repository.  You synchronize
      this branch with changes made in the repository
      using <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>&#x2014;which acts almost like
      a special-cased, simplified form of an <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> command.<a href="#ftn.idm4876" class="footnote" id="idm4876"><sup class="footnote">[36]</sup></a> You effectively reintegrate your branch
      each time you run <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>.  So, in that
      special sense, Subversion users deal with branches and merges
      all the time.  Given the similarities between updating and
      merging, it&apos;s no surprise, then, that the areas in which
      Subversion seems to have the most shortcomings&#x2014;namely,
      handling file and directory renames and dealing with tree
      conflicts in general&#x2014;are problematic for both
      the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> operations.  Unfortunately, <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> has a harder time of it precisely because of the
      fact that, for every way in which <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
      is a special-cased, simplified kind of generic merge operation,
      a true Subversion merge is neither special-cased nor simplified.
      For this reason, merges perform much more slowly than updates,
      require explicit tracking (via
      the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property we&apos;ve discussed in
      this chapter) and history-crunching arithmetic, and generally
      offer more opportunities for something to go awry.</p>
      <p>To branch or not to branch?  Ultimately, that depends on
      what your team needs in order to find that sweet balance of
      collaboration and isolation.</p>
