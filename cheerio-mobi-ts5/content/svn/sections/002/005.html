      <p>This book started out as bits of documentation written by
      Subversion project developers, which were then coalesced into a
      single work and rewritten.  As such, it has always been under a
      free license (see ).  In fact,
      the book was written in the public eye, originally as part of
      the Subversion project itself.  This means two things:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>You will always find the latest version of this book in
          the book&apos;s own Subversion repository.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>You can make changes to this book and redistribute it
          however you wish&#x2014;it&apos;s under a free license.  Your only
          obligation is to maintain proper attribution to the original
          authors.  Of course, we&apos;d much rather you send feedback and
          patches to the Subversion developer community, instead of 
          distributing your private version of this book.</p>

        </ul>

      <p>The online home of this book&apos;s development and most of the
      volunteer-driven translation efforts regarding it is
      <a class="ulink" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com" target="_top">http://svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.  There you can find
      links to the latest releases and tagged versions of the book in
      various formats, as well as instructions for accessing the
      book&apos;s Subversion repository (where its DocBook XML source
      code lives).  Feedback is welcomed&#x2014;encouraged, even.  Please
      submit all comments, complaints, and patches against the book
      sources to <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:svnbook-dev@red-bean.com">svnbook-dev@red-bean.com</a>&gt;</code>.</p>
