As we saw with <code>ByteSize</code>,
methods can be defined for any named type (except a pointer or an interface);
the receiver does not have to be a struct.
</p><p>
In the discussion of slices above, we wrote an <code>Append</code>
function.  We can define it as a method on slices instead.  To do
this, we first declare a named type to which we can bind the method, and
then make the receiver for the method a value of that type.
</p><pre>
type ByteSlice []byte
func (slice ByteSlice) Append(data []byte) []byte {
    // Body exactly the same as the Append function defined above.
}
</pre><p>
This still requires the method to return the updated slice.  We can
eliminate that clumsiness by redefining the method to take a
<i>pointer</i> to a <code>ByteSlice</code> as its receiver, so the
method can overwrite the caller&apos;s slice.
</p><pre>
func (p *ByteSlice) Append(data []byte) {
    slice := *p
    // Body as above, without the return.
    *p = slice
}
</pre><p>
In fact, we can do even better.  If we modify our function so it looks
like a standard <code>Write</code> method, like this,
</p><pre>
func (p *ByteSlice) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error) {
    slice := *p
    // Again as above.
    *p = slice
    return len(data), nil
}
</pre><p>
then the type <code>*ByteSlice</code> satisfies the standard interface
<code>io.Writer</code>, which is handy.  For instance, we can
print into one.
</p><pre>
    var b ByteSlice
    fmt.Fprintf(&amp;b, &quot;This hour has %d days\n&quot;, 7)
</pre><p>
We pass the address of a <code>ByteSlice</code>
because only <code>*ByteSlice</code> satisfies <code>io.Writer</code>.
The rule about pointers vs. values for receivers is that value methods
can be invoked on pointers and values, but pointer methods can only be
invoked on pointers.
</p><p>
This rule arises because pointer methods can modify the receiver; invoking
them on a value would cause the method to receive a copy of the value, so
any modifications would be discarded.
The language therefore disallows this mistake.
There is a handy exception, though. When the value is addressable, the
language takes care of the common case of invoking a pointer method on a
value by inserting the address operator automatically.
In our example, the variable <code>b</code> is addressable, so we can call
its <code>Write</code> method with just <code>b.Write</code>. The compiler
will rewrite that to <code>(&amp;b).Write</code> for us.
</p><p>
By the way, the idea of using <code>Write</code> on a slice of bytes
is central to the implementation of <code>bytes.Buffer</code>.
