Formatting issues are the most contentious
but the least consequential.
People can adapt to different formatting styles
but it&apos;s better if they don&apos;t have to, and
less time is devoted to the topic
if everyone adheres to the same style.
The problem is how to approach this Utopia without a long
prescriptive style guide.
</p><p>
With Go we take an unusual
approach and let the machine
take care of most formatting issues.
The <code>gofmt</code> program
(also available as <code>go fmt</code>, which
operates at the package level rather than source file level)
reads a Go program
and emits the source in a standard style of indentation
and vertical alignment, retaining and if necessary
reformatting comments.
If you want to know how to handle some new layout
situation, run <code>gofmt</code>; if the answer doesn&apos;t
seem right, rearrange your program (or file a bug about <code>gofmt</code>),
don&apos;t work around it.
</p><p>
As an example, there&apos;s no need to spend time lining up
the comments on the fields of a structure.
<code>Gofmt</code> will do that for you.  Given the
declaration
</p><pre>
type T struct {
    name string // name of the object
    value int // its value
}
</pre><p>
<code>gofmt</code> will line up the columns:
</p><pre>
type T struct {
    name    string // name of the object
    value   int    // its value
}
</pre><p>
All Go code in the standard packages has been formatted with <code>gofmt</code>.
</p><p>
Some formatting details remain.  Very briefly:
</p><dl>
    <dt>Indentation</dt>
    <dd>We use tabs for indentation and <code>gofmt</code> emits them by default.
    Use spaces only if you must.
    </dd>
    <dt>Line length</dt>
    <dd>
    Go has no line length limit.  Don&apos;t worry about overflowing a punched card.
    If a line feels too long, wrap it and indent with an extra tab.
    </dd>
    <dt>Parentheses</dt>
    <dd>
    Go needs fewer parentheses than C and Java: control structures (<code>if</code>,
    <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>) do not have parentheses in
    their syntax.
    Also, the operator precedence hierarchy is shorter and clearer, so
<pre>
x&lt;<8 + y<<16 < pre>
    means what the spacing implies, unlike in the other languages.
    </8></pre></dd>
