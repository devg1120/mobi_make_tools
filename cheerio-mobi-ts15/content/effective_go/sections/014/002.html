They&apos;re called <em>goroutines</em> because the existing
terms&#x2014;threads, coroutines, processes, and so on&#x2014;convey
inaccurate connotations.  A goroutine has a simple model: it is a
function executing concurrently with other goroutines in the same
address space.  It is lightweight, costing little more than the
allocation of stack space.
And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow
by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.
</p><p>
Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should
block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run.  Their
design hides many of the complexities of thread creation and
management.
</p><p>
Prefix a function or method call with the <code>go</code>
keyword to run the call in a new goroutine.
When the call completes, the goroutine
exits, silently.  (The effect is similar to the Unix shell&apos;s
<code>&amp;</code> notation for running a command in the
background.)
</p><pre>
go list.Sort()  // run list.Sort concurrently; don&apos;t wait for it.
</pre><p>
A function literal can be handy in a goroutine invocation.
</p><pre>
func Announce(message string, delay time.Duration) {
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(delay)
        fmt.Println(message)
    }()  // Note the parentheses - must call the function.
}
</pre><p>
In Go, function literals are closures: the implementation makes
sure the variables referred to by the function survive as long as they are active.
</p><p>
These examples aren&apos;t too practical because the functions have no way of signaling
completion.  For that, we need channels.
