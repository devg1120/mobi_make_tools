One of the most important properties of Go is that
a channel is a first-class value that can be allocated and passed
around like any other.  A common use of this property is
to implement safe, parallel demultiplexing.
</p><p>
In the example in the previous section, <code>handle</code> was
an idealized handler for a request but we didn&apos;t define the
type it was handling.  If that type includes a channel on which
to reply, each client can provide its own path for the answer.
Here&apos;s a schematic definition of type <code>Request</code>.
</p><pre>
type Request struct {
    args        []int
    f           func([]int) int
    resultChan  chan int
}
</pre><p>
The client provides a function and its arguments, as well as
a channel inside the request object on which to receive the answer.
</p><pre>
func sum(a []int) (s int) {
    for _, v := range a {
        s += v
    }
    return
}
request := &amp;Request{[]int{3, 4, 5}, sum, make(chan int)}
// Send request
clientRequests <- request wait for response. fmt.printf("answer: %d\n", <-request.resultchan) < pre><p>
On the server side, the handler function is the only thing that changes.
</p><pre>
func handle(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        req.resultChan <- req.f(req.args) } < pre><p>
There&apos;s clearly a lot more to do to make it realistic, but this
code is a framework for a rate-limited, parallel, non-blocking RPC
system, and there&apos;s not a mutex in sight.
