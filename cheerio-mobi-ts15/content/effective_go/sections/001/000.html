Go is a new language.  Although it borrows ideas from
existing languages,
it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs
different in character from programs written in its relatives.
A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go
is unlikely to produce a satisfactory result&#x2014;Java programs
are written in Java, not Go.
On the other hand, thinking about the problem from a Go
perspective could produce a successful but quite different
program.
In other words,
to write Go well, it&apos;s important to understand its properties
and idioms.
It&apos;s also important to know the established conventions for
programming in Go, such as naming, formatting, program
construction, and so on, so that programs you write
will be easy for other Go programmers to understand.

This document gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
It augments the [<a>language specification</a>],
the [<a>Tour of Go</a>],
and [<a>How to Write Go Code</a>],
all of which you
should read first.
