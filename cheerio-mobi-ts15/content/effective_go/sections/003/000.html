Go provides C-style <code>/* */</code> block comments
and C++-style <code>//</code> line comments.
Line comments are the norm;
block comments appear mostly as package comments, but
are useful within an expression or to disable large swaths of code.
</p><p>
The program&#x2014;and web server&#x2014;<code>godoc</code> processes
Go source files to extract documentation about the contents of the
package.
Comments that appear before top-level declarations, with no intervening newlines,
are extracted along with the declaration to serve as explanatory text for the item.
The nature and style of these comments determines the
quality of the documentation <code>godoc</code> produces.
</p><p>
Every package should have a <i>package comment</i>, a block
comment preceding the package clause.
For multi-file packages, the package comment only needs to be
present in one file, and any one will do.
The package comment should introduce the package and
provide information relevant to the package as a whole.
It will appear first on the <code>godoc</code> page and
should set up the detailed documentation that follows.
</p><pre>
/*
Package regexp implements a simple library for regular expressions.
The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is:
    regexp:
        concatenation { &apos;|&apos; concatenation }
    concatenation:
        { closure }
    closure:
        term [ &apos;*&apos; | &apos;+&apos; | &apos;?&apos; ]
    term:
        &apos;^&apos;
        &apos;$&apos;
        &apos;.&apos;
        character
        &apos;[&apos; [ &apos;^&apos; ] character-ranges &apos;]&apos;
        &apos;(&apos; regexp &apos;)&apos;
*/
package regexp
</pre><p>
If the package is simple, the package comment can be brief.
</p><pre>
// Package path implements utility routines for
// manipulating slash-separated filename paths.
</pre><p>
Comments do not need extra formatting such as banners of stars.
The generated output may not even be presented in a fixed-width font, so don&apos;t depend
on spacing for alignment&#x2014;<code>godoc</code>, like <code>gofmt</code>,
takes care of that.
The comments are uninterpreted plain text, so HTML and other
annotations such as <code>_this_</code> will reproduce <i>verbatim</i> and should
not be used.
One adjustment <code>godoc</code> does do is to display indented
text in a fixed-width font, suitable for program snippets.
The package comment for the
[<a><code>fmt</code> package</a>] uses this to good effect.
</p><p>
Depending on the context, <code>godoc</code> might not even
reformat comments, so make sure they look good straight up:
use correct spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure,
fold long lines, and so on.
</p><p>
Inside a package, any comment immediately preceding a top-level declaration
serves as a <i>doc comment</i> for that declaration.
Every exported (capitalized) name in a program should
have a doc comment.
</p><p>
Doc comments work best as complete sentences, which allow
a wide variety of automated presentations.
The first sentence should be a one-sentence summary that
starts with the name being declared.
</p><pre>
// Compile parses a regular expression and returns, if successful,
// a Regexp that can be used to match against text.
func Compile(str string) (*Regexp, error) {
</pre><p>
If every doc comment begins with the name of the item it describes,
you can use the [<a>doc</a>]
subcommand of the [<a>go</a>] tool
and run the output through <code>grep</code>.
Imagine you couldn&apos;t remember the name &quot;Compile&quot; but were looking for
the parsing function for regular expressions, so you ran
the command,
</p><pre>
$ go doc -all regexp | grep -i parse
</pre><p>
If all the doc comments in the package began, &quot;This function...&quot;, <code>grep</code>
wouldn&apos;t help you remember the name. But because the package starts each
doc comment with the name, you&apos;d see something like this,
which recalls the word you&apos;re looking for.
</p><pre>
$ go doc -all regexp | grep -i parse
    Compile parses a regular expression and returns, if successful, a Regexp
    MustCompile is like Compile but panics if the expression cannot be parsed.
    parsed. It simplifies safe initialization of global variables holding
$
</pre><p>
Go&apos;s declaration syntax allows grouping of declarations.
A single doc comment can introduce a group of related constants or variables.
Since the whole declaration is presented, such a comment can often be perfunctory.
</p><pre>
// Error codes returned by failures to parse an expression.
var (
    ErrInternal      = errors.New(&quot;regexp: internal error&quot;)
    ErrUnmatchedLpar = errors.New(&quot;regexp: unmatched &apos;(&apos;&quot;)
    ErrUnmatchedRpar = errors.New(&quot;regexp: unmatched &apos;)&apos;&quot;)
    ...
)
</pre><p>
Grouping can also indicate relationships between items,
such as the fact that a set of variables is protected by a mutex.
</p><pre>
var (
    countLock   sync.Mutex
    inputCount  uint32
    outputCount uint32
    errorCount  uint32
)
