The usual way to report an error to a caller is to return an
<code>error</code> as an extra return value.  The canonical
<code>Read</code> method is a well-known instance; it returns a byte
count and an <code>error</code>.  But what if the error is
unrecoverable?  Sometimes the program simply cannot continue.
</p><p>
For this purpose, there is a built-in function <code>panic</code>
that in effect creates a run-time error that will stop the program
(but see the next section).  The function takes a single argument
of arbitrary type&#x2014;often a string&#x2014;to be printed as the
program dies.  It&apos;s also a way to indicate that something impossible has
happened, such as exiting an infinite loop.
</p><pre>
// A toy implementation of cube root using Newton&apos;s method.
func CubeRoot(x float64) float64 {
    z := x/3   // Arbitrary initial value
    for i := 0; i &lt; 1e6; i++ {
        prevz := z
        z -= (z*z*z-x) / (3*z*z)
        if veryClose(z, prevz) {
            return z
        }
    }
    // A million iterations has not converged; something is wrong.
    panic(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;CubeRoot(%g) did not converge&quot;, x))
}
</pre><p>
This is only an example but real library functions should
avoid <code>panic</code>.  If the problem can be masked or worked
around, it&apos;s always better to let things continue to run rather
than taking down the whole program.  One possible counterexample
is during initialization: if the library truly cannot set itself up,
it might be reasonable to panic, so to speak.
</p><pre>
var user = os.Getenv(&quot;USER&quot;)
func init() {
    if user == &quot;&quot; {
        panic(&quot;no value for $USER&quot;)
    }
}
