Like C, Go&apos;s formal grammar uses semicolons to terminate statements,
but unlike in C, those semicolons do not appear in the source.
Instead the lexer uses a simple rule to insert semicolons automatically
as it scans, so the input text is mostly free of them.
</p><p>
The rule is this. If the last token before a newline is an identifier
(which includes words like <code>int</code> and <code>float64</code>),
a basic literal such as a number or string constant, or one of the
tokens
</p><pre>
break continue fallthrough return ++ -- ) }
</pre><p>
the lexer always inserts a semicolon after the token.
This could be summarized as, &#x201C;if the newline comes
after a token that could end a statement, insert a semicolon&#x201D;.
</p><p>
A semicolon can also be omitted immediately before a closing brace,
so a statement such as
</p><pre>
    go func() { for { dst <- <-src } }() < pre><p>
needs no semicolons.
Idiomatic Go programs have semicolons only in places such as
<code>for</code> loop clauses, to separate the initializer, condition, and
continuation elements.  They are also necessary to separate multiple
statements on a line, should you write code that way.
</p><p>
One consequence of the semicolon insertion rules
is that you cannot put the opening brace of a
control structure (<code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>,
or <code>select</code>) on the next line.  If you do, a semicolon
will be inserted before the brace, which could cause unwanted
effects.  Write them like this
</p><pre>
if i &lt; f() {
    g()
}
</pre><p>
not like this
</p><pre>
if i &lt; f()  // wrong!
{           // wrong!
    g()
}
</pre></-></pre></body>
