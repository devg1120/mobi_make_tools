Go&apos;s <code>defer</code> statement schedules a function call (the
<i>deferred</i> function) to be run immediately before the function
executing the <code>defer</code> returns.  It&apos;s an unusual but
effective way to deal with situations such as resources that must be
released regardless of which path a function takes to return.  The
canonical examples are unlocking a mutex or closing a file.
</p><pre>
// Contents returns the file&apos;s contents as a string.
func Contents(filename string) (string, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return &quot;&quot;, err
    }
    defer f.Close()  // f.Close will run when we&apos;re finished.
    var result []byte
    buf := make([]byte, 100)
    for {
        n, err := f.Read(buf[0:])
        result = append(result, buf[0:n]...) // append is discussed later.
        if err != nil {
            if err == io.EOF {
                break
            }
            return &quot;&quot;, err  // f will be closed if we return here.
        }
    }
    return string(result), nil // f will be closed if we return here.
}
</pre><p>
Deferring a call to a function such as <code>Close</code> has two advantages.  First, it
guarantees that you will never forget to close the file, a mistake
that&apos;s easy to make if you later edit the function to add a new return
path.  Second, it means that the close sits near the open,
which is much clearer than placing it at the end of the function.
</p><p>
The arguments to the deferred function (which include the receiver if
the function is a method) are evaluated when the <i>defer</i>
executes, not when the <i>call</i> executes.  Besides avoiding worries
about variables changing values as the function executes, this means
that a single deferred call site can defer multiple function
executions.  Here&apos;s a silly example.
</p><pre>
for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {
    defer fmt.Printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i)
}
</pre><p>
Deferred functions are executed in LIFO order, so this code will cause
<code>4 3 2 1 0</code> to be printed when the function returns.  A
more plausible example is a simple way to trace function execution
through the program.  We could write a couple of simple tracing
routines like this:
</p><pre>
func trace(s string)   { fmt.Println(&quot;entering:&quot;, s) }
func untrace(s string) { fmt.Println(&quot;leaving:&quot;, s) }
// Use them like this:
func a() {
    trace(&quot;a&quot;)
    defer untrace(&quot;a&quot;)
    // do something....
}
</pre><p>
We can do better by exploiting the fact that arguments to deferred
functions are evaluated when the <code>defer</code> executes.  The
tracing routine can set up the argument to the untracing routine.
This example:
</p><pre>
func trace(s string) string {
    fmt.Println(&quot;entering:&quot;, s)
    return s
}
func un(s string) {
    fmt.Println(&quot;leaving:&quot;, s)
}
func a() {
    defer un(trace(&quot;a&quot;))
    fmt.Println(&quot;in a&quot;)
}
func b() {
    defer un(trace(&quot;b&quot;))
    fmt.Println(&quot;in b&quot;)
    a()
}
func main() {
    b()
}
</pre><p>
prints
</p><pre>
entering: b
in b
entering: a
in a
leaving: a
leaving: b
</pre><p>
For programmers accustomed to block-level resource management from
other languages, <code>defer</code> may seem peculiar, but its most
interesting and powerful applications come precisely from the fact
that it&apos;s not block-based but function-based.  In the section on
<code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> we&apos;ll see another
example of its possibilities.
