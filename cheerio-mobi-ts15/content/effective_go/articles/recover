When <code>panic</code> is called, including implicitly for run-time
errors such as indexing a slice out of bounds or failing a type
assertion, it immediately stops execution of the current function
and begins unwinding the stack of the goroutine, running any deferred
functions along the way.  If that unwinding reaches the top of the
goroutine's stack, the program dies.  However, it is possible to
use the built-in function <code>recover</code> to regain control
of the goroutine and resume normal execution.
</p><p>
A call to <code>recover</code> stops the unwinding and returns the
argument passed to <code>panic</code>.  Because the only code that
runs while unwinding is inside deferred functions, <code>recover</code>
is only useful inside deferred functions.
</p><p>
One application of <code>recover</code> is to shut down a failing goroutine
inside a server without killing the other executing goroutines.
</p><pre>
func server(workChan <-chan *Work) {
    for work := range workChan {
        go safelyDo(work)
    }
}

func safelyDo(work *Work) {
    defer func() {
        if err := recover(); err != nil {
            log.Println("work failed:", err)
        }
    }()
    do(work)
}
</pre><p>
In this example, if <code>do(work)</code> panics, the result will be
logged and the goroutine will exit cleanly without disturbing the
others.  There's no need to do anything else in the deferred closure;
calling <code>recover</code> handles the condition completely.
</p><p>
Because <code>recover</code> always returns <code>nil</code> unless called directly
from a deferred function, deferred code can call library routines that themselves
use <code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> without failing.  As an example,
the deferred function in <code>safelyDo</code> might call a logging function before
calling <code>recover</code>, and that logging code would run unaffected
by the panicking state.
</p><p>
With our recovery pattern in place, the <code>do</code>
function (and anything it calls) can get out of any bad situation
cleanly by calling <code>panic</code>.  We can use that idea to
simplify error handling in complex software.  Let's look at an
idealized version of a <code>regexp</code> package, which reports
parsing errors by calling <code>panic</code> with a local
error type.  Here's the definition of <code>Error</code>,
an <code>error</code> method, and the <code>Compile</code> function.
</p><pre>
// Error is the type of a parse error; it satisfies the error interface.
type Error string
func (e Error) Error() string {
    return string(e)
}

// error is a method of *Regexp that reports parsing errors by
// panicking with an Error.
func (regexp *Regexp) error(err string) {
    panic(Error(err))
}

// Compile returns a parsed representation of the regular expression.
func Compile(str string) (regexp *Regexp, err error) {
    regexp = new(Regexp)
    // doParse will panic if there is a parse error.
    defer func() {
        if e := recover(); e != nil {
            regexp = nil    // Clear return value.
            err = e.(Error) // Will re-panic if not a parse error.
        }
    }()
    return regexp.doParse(str), nil
}
</pre><p>
If <code>doParse</code> panics, the recovery block will set the
return value to <code>nil</code>—deferred functions can modify
named return values.  It will then check, in the assignment
to <code>err</code>, that the problem was a parse error by asserting
that it has the local type <code>Error</code>.
If it does not, the type assertion will fail, causing a run-time error
that continues the stack unwinding as though nothing had interrupted
it.
This check means that if something unexpected happens, such
as an index out of bounds, the code will fail even though we
are using <code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> to handle
parse errors.
</p><p>
With error handling in place, the <code>error</code> method (because it's a
method bound to a type, it's fine, even natural, for it to have the same name
as the builtin <code>error</code> type)
makes it easy to report parse errors without worrying about unwinding
the parse stack by hand:
</p><pre>
if pos == 0 {
    re.error("'*' illegal at start of expression")
}
</pre><p>
Useful though this pattern is, it should be used only within a package.
<code>Parse</code> turns its internal <code>panic</code> calls into
<code>error</code> values; it does not expose <code>panics</code>
to its client.  That is a good rule to follow.
</p><p>
By the way, this re-panic idiom changes the panic value if an actual
error occurs.  However, both the original and new failures will be
presented in the crash report, so the root cause of the problem will
still be visible.  Thus this simple re-panic approach is usually
sufficient—it's a crash after all—but if you want to
display only the original value, you can write a little more code to
filter unexpected problems and re-panic with the original error.
That's left as an exercise for the reader.
