If a type exists only to implement an interface and will
never have exported methods beyond that interface, there is
no need to export the type itself.
Exporting just the interface makes it clear the value has no
interesting behavior beyond what is described in the
interface.
It also avoids the need to repeat the documentation
on every instance of a common method.
</p><p>
In such cases, the constructor should return an interface value
rather than the implementing type.
As an example, in the hash libraries
both <code>crc32.NewIEEE</code> and <code>adler32.New</code>
return the interface type <code>hash.Hash32</code>.
Substituting the CRC-32 algorithm for Adler-32 in a Go program
requires only changing the constructor call;
the rest of the code is unaffected by the change of algorithm.
</p><p>
A similar approach allows the streaming cipher algorithms
in the various <code>crypto</code> packages to be
separated from the block ciphers they chain together.
The <code>Block</code> interface
in the <code>crypto/cipher</code> package specifies the
behavior of a block cipher, which provides encryption
of a single block of data.
Then, by analogy with the <code>bufio</code> package,
cipher packages that implement this interface
can be used to construct streaming ciphers, represented
by the <code>Stream</code> interface, without
knowing the details of the block encryption.
</p><p>
The  <code>crypto/cipher</code> interfaces look like this:
</p><pre>
type Block interface {
    BlockSize() int
    Encrypt(dst, src []byte)
    Decrypt(dst, src []byte)
}

type Stream interface {
    XORKeyStream(dst, src []byte)
}
</pre><p>
Here's the definition of the counter mode (CTR) stream,
which turns a block cipher into a streaming cipher; notice
that the block cipher's details are abstracted away:
</p><pre>
// NewCTR returns a Stream that encrypts/decrypts using the given Block in
// counter mode. The length of iv must be the same as the Block's block size.
func NewCTR(block Block, iv []byte) Stream
</pre><p>
<code>NewCTR</code> applies not
just to one specific encryption algorithm and data source but to any
implementation of the <code>Block</code> interface and any
<code>Stream</code>.  Because they return
interface values, replacing CTR
encryption with other encryption modes is a localized change.  The constructor
calls must be edited, but because the surrounding code must treat the result only
as a <code>Stream</code>, it won't notice the difference.
