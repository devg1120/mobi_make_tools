The [<a>Go package sources</a>]
are intended to serve not
only as the core library but also as examples of how to
use the language.
Moreover, many of the packages contain working, self-contained
executable examples you can run directly from the
[<a>golang.org</a>] web site, such as
[<a>this one</a>] (if
necessary, click on the word "Example" to open it up).
If you have a question about how to approach a problem or how something
might be implemented, the documentation, code and examples in the
library can provide answers, ideas and
background.
