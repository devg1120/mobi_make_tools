We've mentioned the blank identifier a couple of times now, in the context of
[<a><code>for</code> <code>range</code> loops</a>]
and [<a>maps</a>].
The blank identifier can be assigned or declared with any value of any type, with the
value discarded harmlessly.
It's a bit like writing to the Unix <code>/dev/null</code> file:
it represents a write-only value
to be used as a place-holder
where a variable is needed but the actual value is irrelevant.
It has uses beyond those we've seen already.
