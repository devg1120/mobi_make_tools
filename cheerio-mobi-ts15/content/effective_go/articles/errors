Library routines must often return some sort of error indication to
the caller.
As mentioned earlier, Go's multivalue return makes it
easy to return a detailed error description alongside the normal
return value.
It is good style to use this feature to provide detailed error information.
For example, as we'll see, <code>os.Open</code> doesn't
just return a <code>nil</code> pointer on failure, it also returns an
error value that describes what went wrong.
</p><p>
By convention, errors have type <code>error</code>,
a simple built-in interface.
</p><pre>
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
</pre><p>
A library writer is free to implement this interface with a
richer model under the covers, making it possible not only
to see the error but also to provide some context.
As mentioned, alongside the usual <code>*os.File</code>
return value, <code>os.Open</code> also returns an
error value.
If the file is opened successfully, the error will be <code>nil</code>,
but when there is a problem, it will hold an
<code>os.PathError</code>:
</p><pre>
// PathError records an error and the operation and
// file path that caused it.
type PathError struct {
    Op string    // "open", "unlink", etc.
    Path string  // The associated file.
    Err error    // Returned by the system call.
}

func (e *PathError) Error() string {
    return e.Op + " " + e.Path + ": " + e.Err.Error()
}
</pre><p>
<code>PathError</code>'s <code>Error</code> generates
a string like this:
</p><pre>
open /etc/passwx: no such file or directory
</pre><p>
Such an error, which includes the problematic file name, the
operation, and the operating system error it triggered, is useful even
if printed far from the call that caused it;
it is much more informative than the plain
"no such file or directory".
</p><p>
When feasible, error strings should identify their origin, such as by having
a prefix naming the operation or package that generated the error.  For example, in package
<code>image</code>, the string representation for a decoding error due to an
unknown format is "image: unknown format".
</p><p>
Callers that care about the precise error details can
use a type switch or a type assertion to look for specific
errors and extract details.  For <code>PathErrors</code>
this might include examining the internal <code>Err</code>
field for recoverable failures.
</p><pre>
for try := 0; try < 2; try++ {
    file, err = os.Create(filename)
    if err == nil {
        return
    }
    if e, ok := err.(*os.PathError); ok && e.Err == syscall.ENOSPC {
        deleteTempFiles()  // Recover some space.
        continue
    }
    return
}
</pre><p>
The second <code>if</code> statement here is another [<a>type assertion</a>].
If it fails, <code>ok</code> will be false, and <code>e</code>
will be <code>nil</code>.
If it succeeds,  <code>ok</code> will be true, which means the
error was of type <code>*os.PathError</code>, and then so is <code>e</code>,
which we can examine for more information about the error.
