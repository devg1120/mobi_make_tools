"Switch" statements provide multi-way execution.
An expression or type specifier is compared to the "cases"
inside the "switch" to determine which branch
to execute.
</p><pre>
[<a>SwitchStmt</a>] = [<a>ExprSwitchStmt</a>] | [<a>TypeSwitchStmt</a>] .
</pre><p>
There are two forms: expression switches and type switches.
In an expression switch, the cases contain expressions that are compared
against the value of the switch expression.
In a type switch, the cases contain types that are compared against the
type of a specially annotated switch expression.
The switch expression is evaluated exactly once in a switch statement.
</p><h4>Expression switches</h4><p>
In an expression switch,
the switch expression is evaluated and
the case expressions, which need not be constants,
are evaluated left-to-right and top-to-bottom; the first one that equals the
switch expression
triggers execution of the statements of the associated case;
the other cases are skipped.
If no case matches and there is a "default" case,
its statements are executed.
There can be at most one default case and it may appear anywhere in the
"switch" statement.
A missing switch expression is equivalent to the boolean value
<code>true</code>.
</p><pre>
[<a>ExprSwitchStmt</a>] = "switch" [ [<a>SimpleStmt</a>] ";" ] [ [<a>Expression</a>] ] "{" { [<a>ExprCaseClause</a>] } "}" .
[<a>ExprCaseClause</a>] = [<a>ExprSwitchCase</a>] ":" [<a>StatementList</a>] .
[<a>ExprSwitchCase</a>] = "case" [<a>ExpressionList</a>] | "default" .
</pre><p>
If the switch expression evaluates to an untyped constant, it is first implicitly
[<a>converted</a>] to its [<a>default type</a>];
if it is an untyped boolean value, it is first implicitly converted to type <code>bool</code>.
The predeclared untyped value <code>nil</code> cannot be used as a switch expression.
</p><p>
If a case expression is untyped, it is first implicitly [<a>converted</a>]
to the type of the switch expression.
For each (possibly converted) case expression <code>x</code> and the value <code>t</code>
of the switch expression, <code>x == t</code> must be a valid [<a>comparison</a>].
</p><p>
In other words, the switch expression is treated as if it were used to declare and
initialize a temporary variable <code>t</code> without explicit type; it is that
value of <code>t</code> against which each case expression <code>x</code> is tested
for equality.
</p><p>
In a case or default clause, the last non-empty statement
may be a (possibly [<a>labeled</a>])
[<a>"fallthrough" statement</a>] to
indicate that control should flow from the end of this clause to
the first statement of the next clause.
Otherwise control flows to the end of the "switch" statement.
A "fallthrough" statement may appear as the last statement of all
but the last clause of an expression switch.
</p><p>
The switch expression may be preceded by a simple statement, which
executes before the expression is evaluated.
</p><pre>
switch tag {
default: s3()
case 0, 1, 2, 3: s1()
case 4, 5, 6, 7: s2()
}

switch x := f(); {  // missing switch expression means "true"
case x < 0: return -x
default: return x
}

switch {
case x < y: f1()
case x < z: f2()
case x == 4: f3()
}
</pre><p>
Implementation restriction: A compiler may disallow multiple case
expressions evaluating to the same constant.
For instance, the current compilers disallow duplicate integer,
floating point, or string constants in case expressions.
</p><h4>Type switches</h4><p>
A type switch compares types rather than values. It is otherwise similar
to an expression switch. It is marked by a special switch expression that
has the form of a [<a>type assertion</a>]
using the reserved word <code>type</code> rather than an actual type:
</p><pre>
switch x.(type) {
// cases
}
</pre><p>
Cases then match actual types <code>T</code> against the dynamic type of the
expression <code>x</code>. As with type assertions, <code>x</code> must be of
[<a>interface type</a>], and each non-interface type
<code>T</code> listed in a case must implement the type of <code>x</code>.
The types listed in the cases of a type switch must all be
[<a>different</a>].
</p><pre>
[<a>TypeSwitchStmt</a>]  = "switch" [ [<a>SimpleStmt</a>] ";" ] [<a>TypeSwitchGuard</a>] "{" { [<a>TypeCaseClause</a>] } "}" .
[<a>TypeSwitchGuard</a>] = [ [<a>identifier</a>] ":=" ] [<a>PrimaryExpr</a>] "." "(" "type" ")" .
[<a>TypeCaseClause</a>]  = [<a>TypeSwitchCase</a>] ":" [<a>StatementList</a>] .
[<a>TypeSwitchCase</a>]  = "case" [<a>TypeList</a>] | "default" .
[<a>TypeList</a>]        = [<a>Type</a>] { "," [<a>Type</a>] } .
</pre><p>
The TypeSwitchGuard may include a
[<a>short variable declaration</a>].
When that form is used, the variable is declared at the end of the
TypeSwitchCase in the [<a>implicit block</a>] of each clause.
In clauses with a case listing exactly one type, the variable
has that type; otherwise, the variable has the type of the expression
in the TypeSwitchGuard.
</p><p>
Instead of a type, a case may use the predeclared identifier
[<a><code>nil</code></a>];
that case is selected when the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard
is a <code>nil</code> interface value.
There may be at most one <code>nil</code> case.
</p><p>
Given an expression <code>x</code> of type <code>interface{}</code>,
the following type switch:
</p><pre>
switch i := x.(type) {
case nil:
	printString("x is nil")                // type of i is type of x (interface{})
case int:
	printInt(i)                            // type of i is int
case float64:
	printFloat64(i)                        // type of i is float64
case func(int) float64:
	printFunction(i)                       // type of i is func(int) float64
case bool, string:
	printString("type is bool or string")  // type of i is type of x (interface{})
default:
	printString("don't know the type")     // type of i is type of x (interface{})
}
</pre><p>
could be rewritten:
</p><pre>
v := x  // x is evaluated exactly once
if v == nil {
	i := v                                 // type of i is type of x (interface{})
	printString("x is nil")
} else if i, isInt := v.(int); isInt {
	printInt(i)                            // type of i is int
} else if i, isFloat64 := v.(float64); isFloat64 {
	printFloat64(i)                        // type of i is float64
} else if i, isFunc := v.(func(int) float64); isFunc {
	printFunction(i)                       // type of i is func(int) float64
} else {
	_, isBool := v.(bool)
	_, isString := v.(string)
	if isBool || isString {
		i := v                         // type of i is type of x (interface{})
		printString("type is bool or string")
	} else {
		i := v                         // type of i is type of x (interface{})
		printString("don't know the type")
	}
}
</pre><p>
The type switch guard may be preceded by a simple statement, which
executes before the guard is evaluated.
</p><p>
The "fallthrough" statement is not permitted in a type switch.
