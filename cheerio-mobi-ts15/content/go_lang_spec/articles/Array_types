An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single
type, called the element type.
The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.
</p><pre>
[<a>ArrayType</a>]   = "[" [<a>ArrayLength</a>] "]" [<a>ElementType</a>] .
[<a>ArrayLength</a>] = [<a>Expression</a>] .
[<a>ElementType</a>] = [<a>Type</a>] .
</pre><p>
The length is part of the array's type; it must evaluate to a
non-negative [<a>constant</a>]
[<a>representable</a>] by a value
of type <code>int</code>.
The length of array <code>a</code> can be discovered
using the built-in function [<a><code>len</code></a>].
The elements can be addressed by integer [<a>indices</a>]
0 through <code>len(a)-1</code>.
Array types are always one-dimensional but may be composed to form
multi-dimensional types.
