Composite literals construct values for structs, arrays, slices, and maps
and create a new value each time they are evaluated.
They consist of the type of the literal followed by a brace-bound list of elements.
Each element may optionally be preceded by a corresponding key.
</p><pre>
[<a>CompositeLit</a>]  = [<a>LiteralType</a>] [<a>LiteralValue</a>] .
[<a>LiteralType</a>]   = [<a>StructType</a>] | [<a>ArrayType</a>] | "[" "..." "]" [<a>ElementType</a>] |
                [<a>SliceType</a>] | [<a>MapType</a>] | [<a>TypeName</a>] .
[<a>LiteralValue</a>]  = "{" [ [<a>ElementList</a>] [ "," ] ] "}" .
[<a>ElementList</a>]   = [<a>KeyedElement</a>] { "," [<a>KeyedElement</a>] } .
[<a>KeyedElement</a>]  = [ [<a>Key</a>] ":" ] [<a>Element</a>] .
[<a>Key</a>]           = [<a>FieldName</a>] | [<a>Expression</a>] | [<a>LiteralValue</a>] .
[<a>FieldName</a>]     = [<a>identifier</a>] .
[<a>Element</a>]       = [<a>Expression</a>] | [<a>LiteralValue</a>] .

The LiteralType's underlying type must be a struct, array, slice, or map type
(the grammar enforces this constraint except when the type is given
as a TypeName).
The types of the elements and keys must be [<a>assignable</a>]
to the respective field, element, and key types of the literal type;
there is no additional conversion.
The key is interpreted as a field name for struct literals,
an index for array and slice literals, and a key for map literals.
For map literals, all elements must have a key. It is an error
to specify multiple elements with the same field name or
constant key value. For non-constant map keys, see the section on
[<a>evaluation order</a>].
</p><p>
For struct literals the following rules apply:
</p><ul>
	<li>A key must be a field name declared in the struct type.
	</li>
	<li>An element list that does not contain any keys must
	    list an element for each struct field in the
	    order in which the fields are declared.
	</li>
	<li>If any element has a key, every element must have a key.
	</li>
	<li>An element list that contains keys does not need to
	    have an element for each struct field. Omitted fields
	    get the zero value for that field.
	</li>
	<li>A literal may omit the element list; such a literal evaluates
	    to the zero value for its type.
	</li>
	<li>It is an error to specify an element for a non-exported
	    field of a struct belonging to a different package.
	</li>
</ul><p>
Given the declarations
</p><pre>
type Point3D struct { x, y, z float64 }
type Line struct { p, q Point3D }
</pre><p>
one may write
</p><pre>
origin := Point3D{}                            // zero value for Point3D
line := Line{origin, Point3D{y: -4, z: 12.3}}  // zero value for line.q.x
</pre><p>
For array and slice literals the following rules apply:
</p><ul>
	<li>Each element has an associated integer index marking
	    its position in the array.
	</li>
	<li>An element with a key uses the key as its index. The
	    key must be a non-negative constant
	    [<a>representable</a>] by
	    a value of type <code>int</code>; and if it is typed
	    it must be of integer type.
	</li>
	<li>An element without a key uses the previous element's index plus one.
	    If the first element has no key, its index is zero.
	</li>
</ul><p>
[<a>Taking the address</a>] of a composite literal
generates a pointer to a unique [<a>variable</a>] initialized
with the literal's value.
</p><pre>
var pointer *Point3D = &Point3D{y: 1000}
</pre><p>
Note that the [<a>zero value</a>] for a slice or map
type is not the same as an initialized but empty value of the same type.
Consequently, taking the address of an empty slice or map composite literal
does not have the same effect as allocating a new slice or map value with
[<a>new</a>].
</p><pre>
p1 := &[]int{}    // p1 points to an initialized, empty slice with value []int{} and length 0
p2 := new([]int)  // p2 points to an uninitialized slice with value nil and length 0
</pre><p>
The length of an array literal is the length specified in the literal type.
If fewer elements than the length are provided in the literal, the missing
elements are set to the zero value for the array element type.
It is an error to provide elements with index values outside the index range
of the array. The notation <code>...</code> specifies an array length equal
to the maximum element index plus one.
</p><pre>
buffer := [10]string{}             // len(buffer) == 10
intSet := [6]int{1, 2, 3, 5}       // len(intSet) == 6
days := [...]string{"Sat", "Sun"}  // len(days) == 2
</pre><p>
A slice literal describes the entire underlying array literal.
Thus the length and capacity of a slice literal are the maximum
element index plus one. A slice literal has the form
</p><pre>
[]T{x1, x2, … xn}
</pre><p>
and is shorthand for a slice operation applied to an array:
</p><pre>
tmp := [n]T{x1, x2, … xn}
tmp[0 : n]
</pre><p>
Within a composite literal of array, slice, or map type <code>T</code>,
elements or map keys that are themselves composite literals may elide the respective
literal type if it is identical to the element or key type of <code>T</code>.
Similarly, elements or keys that are addresses of composite literals may elide
the <code>&T</code> when the element or key type is <code>*T</code>.
</p><pre>
[...]Point{{1.5, -3.5}, {0, 0}}     // same as [...]Point{Point{1.5, -3.5}, Point{0, 0}}
[][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}}          // same as [][]int{[]int{1, 2, 3}, []int{4, 5}}
[][]Point{{{0, 1}, {1, 2}}}         // same as [][]Point{[]Point{Point{0, 1}, Point{1, 2}}}
map[string]Point{"orig": {0, 0}}    // same as map[string]Point{"orig": Point{0, 0}}
map[Point]string{{0, 0}: "orig"}    // same as map[Point]string{Point{0, 0}: "orig"}

type PPoint *Point
[2]*Point{{1.5, -3.5}, {}}          // same as [2]*Point{&Point{1.5, -3.5}, &Point{}}
[2]PPoint{{1.5, -3.5}, {}}          // same as [2]PPoint{PPoint(&Point{1.5, -3.5}), PPoint(&Point{})}
</pre><p>
A parsing ambiguity arises when a composite literal using the
TypeName form of the LiteralType appears as an operand between the
[<a>keyword</a>] and the opening brace of the block
of an "if", "for", or "switch" statement, and the composite literal
is not enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces.
In this rare case, the opening brace of the literal is erroneously parsed
as the one introducing the block of statements. To resolve the ambiguity,
the composite literal must appear within parentheses.

Examples of valid array, slice, and map literals:
</p><pre>
// list of prime numbers
primes := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2147483647}

// vowels[ch] is true if ch is a vowel
vowels := [128]bool{'a': true, 'e': true, 'i': true, 'o': true, 'u': true, 'y': true}

// the array [10]float32{-1, 0, 0, 0, -0.1, -0.1, 0, 0, 0, -1}
filter := [10]float32{-1, 4: -0.1, -0.1, 9: -1}

// frequencies in Hz for equal-tempered scale (A4 = 440Hz)
noteFrequency := map[string]float32{
	"C0": 16.35, "D0": 18.35, "E0": 20.60, "F0": 21.83,
	"G0": 24.50, "A0": 27.50, "B0": 30.87,
