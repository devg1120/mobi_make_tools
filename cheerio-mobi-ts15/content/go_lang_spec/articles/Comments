Comments serve as program documentation. There are two forms:
</p><ol>
<li>
<i>Line comments</i> start with the character sequence <code>//</code>
and stop at the end of the line.
</li>
<li>
<i>General comments</i> start with the character sequence <code>/*</code>
and stop with the first subsequent character sequence <code>*/</code>.
</li>
</ol><p>
A comment cannot start inside a [<a>rune</a>] or
[<a>string literal</a>], or inside a comment.
A general comment containing no newlines acts like a space.
Any other comment acts like a newline.
