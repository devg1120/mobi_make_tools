Labels are declared by [<a>labeled statements</a>] and are
used in the [<a>"break"</a>],
[<a>"continue"</a>], and
[<a>"goto"</a>] statements.
It is illegal to define a label that is never used.
In contrast to other identifiers, labels are not block scoped and do
not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label
is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes
the body of any nested function.
