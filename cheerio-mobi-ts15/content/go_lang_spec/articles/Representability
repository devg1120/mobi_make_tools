A [<a>constant</a>] <code>x</code> is <i>representable</i>
by a value of type <code>T</code> if one of the following conditions applies:
</p><ul>
<li>
<code>x</code> is in the set of values [<a>determined</a>] by <code>T</code>.
</li>

<li>
<code>T</code> is a floating-point type and <code>x</code> can be rounded to <code>T</code>'s
precision without overflow. Rounding uses IEEE 754 round-to-even rules but with an IEEE
negative zero further simplified to an unsigned zero. Note that constant values never result
in an IEEE negative zero, NaN, or infinity.
</li>

<li>
<code>T</code> is a complex type, and <code>x</code>'s
[<a>components</a>] <code>real(x)</code> and <code>imag(x)</code>
are representable by values of <code>T</code>'s component type (<code>float32</code> or
<code>float64</code>).
</li>
</ul><pre>
x                   T           x is representable by a value of T because

'a'                 byte        97 is in the set of byte values
97                  rune        rune is an alias for int32, and 97 is in the set of 32-bit integers
"foo"               string      "foo" is in the set of string values
1024                int16       1024 is in the set of 16-bit integers
42.0                byte        42 is in the set of unsigned 8-bit integers
1e10                uint64      10000000000 is in the set of unsigned 64-bit integers
2.718281828459045   float32     2.718281828459045 rounds to 2.7182817 which is in the set of float32 values
-1e-1000            float64     -1e-1000 rounds to IEEE -0.0 which is further simplified to 0.0
0i                  int         0 is an integer value
(42 + 0i)           float32     42.0 (with zero imaginary part) is in the set of float32 values

x                   T           x is not representable by a value of T because

0                   bool        0 is not in the set of boolean values
'a'                 string      'a' is a rune, it is not in the set of string values
1024                byte        1024 is not in the set of unsigned 8-bit integers
-1                  uint16      -1 is not in the set of unsigned 16-bit integers
1.1                 int         1.1 is not an integer value
42i                 float32     (0 + 42i) is not in the set of float32 values
1e1000              float64     1e1000 overflows to IEEE +Inf after rounding
