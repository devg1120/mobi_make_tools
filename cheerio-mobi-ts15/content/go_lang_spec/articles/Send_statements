A send statement sends a value on a channel.
The channel expression must be of [<a>channel type</a>],
the channel direction must permit send operations,
and the type of the value to be sent must be [<a>assignable</a>]
to the channel's element type.
</p><pre>
[<a>SendStmt</a>] = [<a>Channel</a>] "<-" [<a>Expression</a>] .
[<a>Channel</a>]  = [<a>Expression</a>] .
</pre><p>
Both the channel and the value expression are evaluated before communication
begins. Communication blocks until the send can proceed.
A send on an unbuffered channel can proceed if a receiver is ready.
A send on a buffered channel can proceed if there is room in the buffer.
A send on a closed channel proceeds by causing a [<a>run-time panic</a>].
A send on a <code>nil</code> channel blocks forever.

ch <- 3  // send value 3 to channel ch
