This is a reference manual for the Go programming language. For
more information and other documents, see [<a>golang.org</a>].
</p><p>
Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming
in mind. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected and has explicit
support for concurrent programming.  Programs are constructed from
<i>packages</i>, whose properties allow efficient management of
dependencies.

The grammar is compact and regular, allowing for easy analysis by
automatic tools such as integrated development environments.
