A complete program is created by linking a single, unimported package
called the <i>main package</i> with all the packages it imports, transitively.
The main package must
have package name <code>main</code> and
declare a function <code>main</code> that takes no
arguments and returns no value.
</p><pre>
func main() { â€¦ }
</pre><p>
Program execution begins by initializing the main package and then
invoking the function <code>main</code>.
When that function invocation returns, the program exits.
It does not wait for other (non-<code>main</code>) goroutines to complete.
