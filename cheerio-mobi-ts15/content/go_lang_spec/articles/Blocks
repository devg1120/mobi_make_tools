A <i>block</i> is a possibly empty sequence of declarations and statements
within matching brace brackets.
</p><pre>
[<a>Block</a>] = "{" [<a>StatementList</a>] "}" .
[<a>StatementList</a>] = { [<a>Statement</a>] ";" } .
</pre><p>
In addition to explicit blocks in the source code, there are implicit blocks:
</p><ol>
	<li>The <i>universe block</i> encompasses all Go source text.</li>

	<li>Each [<a>package</a>] has a <i>package block</i> containing all
	    Go source text for that package.</li>

	<li>Each file has a <i>file block</i> containing all Go source text
	    in that file.</li>

	<li>Each [<a>"if"</a>],
	    [<a>"for"</a>], and
	    [<a>"switch"</a>]
	    statement is considered to be in its own implicit block.</li>

	<li>Each clause in a [<a>"switch"</a>]
	    or [<a>"select"</a>] statement
	    acts as an implicit block.</li>
</ol><p>
Blocks nest and influence [<a>scoping</a>].
