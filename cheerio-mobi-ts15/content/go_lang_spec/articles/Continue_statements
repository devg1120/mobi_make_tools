A "continue" statement begins the next iteration of the
innermost [<a>"for" loop</a>] at its post statement.
The "for" loop must be within the same function.
</p><pre>
[<a>ContinueStmt</a>] = "continue" [ [<a>Label</a>] ] .
</pre><p>
If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing
"for" statement, and that is the one whose execution
advances.

RowLoop:
	for y, row := range rows {
		for x, data := range row {
			if data == endOfRow {
				continue RowLoop
			}
			row[x] = data + bias(x, y)
		}
