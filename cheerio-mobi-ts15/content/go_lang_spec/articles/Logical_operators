Logical operators apply to [<a>boolean</a>] values
and yield a result of the same type as the operands.
The right operand is evaluated conditionally.

&&    conditional AND    p && q  is  "if p then q else false"
||    conditional OR     p || q  is  "if p then true else q"
!     NOT                !p      is  "not p"
