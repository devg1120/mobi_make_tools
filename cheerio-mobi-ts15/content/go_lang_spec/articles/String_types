A <i>string type</i> represents the set of string values.
A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes.
The number of bytes is called the length of the string and is never negative.
Strings are immutable: once created,
it is impossible to change the contents of a string.
The predeclared string type is <code>string</code>;
it is a [<a>defined type</a>].
</p><p>
The length of a string <code>s</code> can be discovered using
the built-in function [<a><code>len</code></a>].
The length is a compile-time constant if the string is a constant.
A string's bytes can be accessed by integer [<a>indices</a>]
0 through <code>len(s)-1</code>.
It is illegal to take the address of such an element; if
<code>s[i]</code> is the <code>i</code>'th byte of a
string, <code>&s[i]</code> is invalid.
