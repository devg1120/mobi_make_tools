Built-in functions are
[<a>predeclared</a>].
They are called like any other function but some of them
accept a type instead of an expression as the first argument.
</p><p>
The built-in functions do not have standard Go types,
so they can only appear in [<a>call expressions</a>];
they cannot be used as function values.
