Current implementations provide several built-in functions useful during
bootstrapping. These functions are documented for completeness but are not
guaranteed to stay in the language. They do not return a result.

Function   Behavior

print      prints all arguments; formatting of arguments is implementation-specific
println    like print but prints spaces between arguments and a newline at the end
</pre><p>
Implementation restriction: <code>print</code> and <code>println</code> need not
accept arbitrary argument types, but printing of boolean, numeric, and string
[<a>types</a>] must be supported.
