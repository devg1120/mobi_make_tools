A &quot;for&quot; statement specifies repeated execution of a block. There are three forms:
The iteration may be controlled by a single condition, a &quot;for&quot; clause, or a &quot;range&quot; clause.
</p><pre>
[<a>ForStmt</a>] = &quot;for&quot; [ [<a>Condition</a>] | [<a>ForClause</a>] | [<a>RangeClause</a>] ] [<a>Block</a>] .
[<a>Condition</a>] = [<a>Expression</a>] .
</pre><h4>For statements with single condition</h4><p>
In its simplest form, a &quot;for&quot; statement specifies the repeated execution of
a block as long as a boolean condition evaluates to true.
The condition is evaluated before each iteration.
If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to the boolean value
<code>true</code>.
</p><pre>
for a &lt; b {
	a *= 2
}
</pre><h4>For statements with <code>for</code> clause</h4><p>
A &quot;for&quot; statement with a ForClause is also controlled by its condition, but
additionally it may specify an <i>init</i>
and a <i>post</i> statement, such as an assignment,
an increment or decrement statement. The init statement may be a
[<a>short variable declaration</a>], but the post statement must not.
Variables declared by the init statement are re-used in each iteration.
</p><pre>
[<a>ForClause</a>] = [ [<a>InitStmt</a>] ] &quot;;&quot; [ [<a>Condition</a>] ] &quot;;&quot; [ [<a>PostStmt</a>] ] .
[<a>InitStmt</a>] = [<a>SimpleStmt</a>] .
[<a>PostStmt</a>] = [<a>SimpleStmt</a>] .
</pre><pre>
for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
	f(i)
}
</pre><p>
If non-empty, the init statement is executed once before evaluating the
condition for the first iteration;
the post statement is executed after each execution of the block (and
only if the block was executed).
Any element of the ForClause may be empty but the
[<a>semicolons</a>] are
required unless there is only a condition.
If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to the boolean value
<code>true</code>.
</p><pre>
for cond { S() }    is the same as    for ; cond ; { S() }
for      { S() }    is the same as    for true     { S() }
</pre><h4>For statements with <code>range</code> clause</h4><p>
A &quot;for&quot; statement with a &quot;range&quot; clause
iterates through all entries of an array, slice, string or map,
or values received on a channel. For each entry it assigns <i>iteration values</i>
to corresponding <i>iteration variables</i> if present and then executes the block.
</p><pre>
[<a>RangeClause</a>] = [ [<a>ExpressionList</a>] &quot;=&quot; | [<a>IdentifierList</a>] &quot;:=&quot; ] &quot;range&quot; [<a>Expression</a>] .
</pre><p>
The expression on the right in the &quot;range&quot; clause is called the <i>range expression</i>,
which may be an array, pointer to an array, slice, string, map, or channel permitting
[<a>receive operations</a>].
As with an assignment, if present the operands on the left must be
[<a>addressable</a>] or map index expressions; they
denote the iteration variables. If the range expression is a channel, at most
one iteration variable is permitted, otherwise there may be up to two.
If the last iteration variable is the [<a>blank identifier</a>],
the range clause is equivalent to the same clause without that identifier.
</p><p>
The range expression <code>x</code> is evaluated once before beginning the loop,
with one exception: if at most one iteration variable is present and
<code>len(x)</code> is [<a>constant</a>],
the range expression is not evaluated.
</p><p>
Function calls on the left are evaluated once per iteration.
For each iteration, iteration values are produced as follows
if the respective iteration variables are present:
</p><pre>
Range expression                          1st value          2nd value
array or slice  a  [n]E, *[n]E, or []E    index    i  int    a[i]       E
string          s  string type            index    i  int    see below  rune
map             m  map[K]V                key      k  K      m[k]       V
channel         c  chan E, <-chan e element < pre><ol>
<li>
For an array, pointer to array, or slice value <code>a</code>, the index iteration
values are produced in increasing order, starting at element index 0.
If at most one iteration variable is present, the range loop produces
iteration values from 0 up to <code>len(a)-1</code> and does not index into the array
or slice itself. For a <code>nil</code> slice, the number of iterations is 0.
</li>
<li>
For a string value, the &quot;range&quot; clause iterates over the Unicode code points
in the string starting at byte index 0.  On successive iterations, the index value will be the
index of the first byte of successive UTF-8-encoded code points in the string,
and the second value, of type <code>rune</code>, will be the value of
the corresponding code point.  If the iteration encounters an invalid
UTF-8 sequence, the second value will be <code>0xFFFD</code>,
the Unicode replacement character, and the next iteration will advance
a single byte in the string.
</li>
<li>
The iteration order over maps is not specified
and is not guaranteed to be the same from one iteration to the next.
If a map entry that has not yet been reached is removed during iteration,
the corresponding iteration value will not be produced. If a map entry is
created during iteration, that entry may be produced during the iteration or
may be skipped. The choice may vary for each entry created and from one
iteration to the next.
If the map is <code>nil</code>, the number of iterations is 0.
</li>
<li>
For channels, the iteration values produced are the successive values sent on
the channel until the channel is [<a>closed</a>]. If the channel
is <code>nil</code>, the range expression blocks forever.
</li>
</ol><p>
The iteration values are assigned to the respective
iteration variables as in an [<a>assignment statement</a>].
</p><p>
The iteration variables may be declared by the &quot;range&quot; clause using a form of
[<a>short variable declaration</a>]
(<code>:=</code>).
In this case their types are set to the types of the respective iteration values
and their [<a>scope</a>] is the block of the &quot;for&quot;
statement; they are re-used in each iteration.
If the iteration variables are declared outside the &quot;for&quot; statement,
after execution their values will be those of the last iteration.
