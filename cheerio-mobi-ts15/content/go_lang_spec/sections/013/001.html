For a channel <code>c</code>, the built-in function <code>close(c)</code>
records that no more values will be sent on the channel.
It is an error if <code>c</code> is a receive-only channel.
Sending to or closing a closed channel causes a [<a>run-time panic</a>].
Closing the nil channel also causes a [<a>run-time panic</a>].
After calling <code>close</code>, and after any previously
sent values have been received, receive operations will return
the zero value for the channel&apos;s type without blocking.
The multi-valued [<a>receive operation</a>]
returns a received value along with an indication of whether the channel is closed.
