<body><p>There are <i>boolean constants</i>,
<i>rune constants</i>,
<i>integer constants</i>,
<i>floating-point constants</i>, <i>complex constants</i>,
and <i>string constants</i>. Rune, integer, floating-point,
and complex constants are
collectively called <i>numeric constants</i>.
</p><p>
A constant value is represented by a
[<a>rune</a>],
[<a>integer</a>],
[<a>floating-point</a>],
[<a>imaginary</a>],
or
[<a>string</a>] literal,
an identifier denoting a constant,
a [<a>constant expression</a>],
a [<a>conversion</a>] with a result that is a constant, or
the result value of some built-in functions such as
<code>unsafe.Sizeof</code> applied to any value,
<code>cap</code> or <code>len</code> applied to
[<a>some expressions</a>],
<code>real</code> and <code>imag</code> applied to a complex constant
and <code>complex</code> applied to numeric constants.
The boolean truth values are represented by the predeclared constants
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. The predeclared identifier
[<a>iota</a>] denotes an integer constant.
</p><p>
In general, complex constants are a form of
[<a>constant expression</a>]
and are discussed in that section.
</p><p>
Numeric constants represent exact values of arbitrary precision and do not overflow.
Consequently, there are no constants denoting the IEEE-754 negative zero, infinity,
and not-a-number values.
</p><p>
Constants may be [<a>typed</a>] or <i>untyped</i>.
Literal constants, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>iota</code>,
and certain [<a>constant expressions</a>]
containing only untyped constant operands are untyped.
</p><p>
A constant may be given a type explicitly by a [<a>constant declaration</a>]
or [<a>conversion</a>], or implicitly when used in a
[<a>variable declaration</a>] or an
[<a>assignment</a>] or as an
operand in an [<a>expression</a>].
It is an error if the constant value
cannot be [<a>represented</a>] as a value of the respective type.
</p><p>
An untyped constant has a <i>default type</i> which is the type to which the
constant is implicitly converted in contexts where a typed value is required,
for instance, in a [<a>short variable declaration</a>]
such as <code>i := 0</code> where there is no explicit type.
The default type of an untyped constant is <code>bool</code>, <code>rune</code>,
<code>int</code>, <code>float64</code>, <code>complex128</code> or <code>string</code>
respectively, depending on whether it is a boolean, rune, integer, floating-point,
complex, or string constant.
</p><p>
Implementation restriction: Although numeric constants have arbitrary
precision in the language, a compiler may implement them using an
internal representation with limited precision.  That said, every
implementation must:
</p><ul>
	<li>Represent integer constants with at least 256 bits.</li>
	<li>Represent floating-point constants, including the parts of
	    a complex constant, with a mantissa of at least 256 bits
	    and a signed binary exponent of at least 16 bits.</li>
	<li>Give an error if unable to represent an integer constant
	    precisely.</li>
	<li>Give an error if unable to represent a floating-point or
	    complex constant due to overflow.</li>
	<li>Round to the nearest representable constant if unable to
	    represent a floating-point or complex constant due to limits
	    on precision.</li>
</ul><p>
These requirements apply both to literal constants and to the result
of evaluating [<a>constant
expressions</a>].
