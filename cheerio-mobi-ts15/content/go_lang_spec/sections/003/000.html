Source code is Unicode text encoded in
[<a>UTF-8</a>]. The text is not
canonicalized, so a single accented code point is distinct from the
same character constructed from combining an accent and a letter;
those are treated as two code points.  For simplicity, this document
will use the unqualified term <i>character</i> to refer to a Unicode code point
in the source text.
</p><p>
Each code point is distinct; for instance, upper and lower case letters
are different characters.
</p><p>
Implementation restriction: For compatibility with other tools, a
compiler may disallow the NUL character (U+0000) in the source text.
</p><p>
Implementation restriction: For compatibility with other tools, a
compiler may ignore a UTF-8-encoded byte order mark
(U+FEFF) if it is the first Unicode code point in the source text.
A byte order mark may be disallowed anywhere else in the source.
