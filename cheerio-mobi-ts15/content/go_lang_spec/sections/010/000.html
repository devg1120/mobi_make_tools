A <i>declaration</i> binds a non-[<a>blank</a>] identifier to a
[<a>constant</a>],
[<a>type</a>],
[<a>variable</a>],
[<a>function</a>],
[<a>label</a>], or
[<a>package</a>].
Every identifier in a program must be declared.
No identifier may be declared twice in the same block, and
no identifier may be declared in both the file and package block.
</p><p>
The [<a>blank identifier</a>] may be used like any other identifier
in a declaration, but it does not introduce a binding and thus is not declared.
In the package block, the identifier <code>init</code> may only be used for
[<a><code>init</code> function</a>] declarations,
and like the blank identifier it does not introduce a new binding.
</p><pre>
[<a>Declaration</a>]   = [<a>ConstDecl</a>] | [<a>TypeDecl</a>] | [<a>VarDecl</a>] .
[<a>TopLevelDecl</a>]  = [<a>Declaration</a>] | [<a>FunctionDecl</a>] | [<a>MethodDecl</a>] .
</pre><p>
The <i>scope</i> of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which
the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, label, or package.
</p><p>
Go is lexically scoped using [<a>blocks</a>]:
</p><ol>
	<li>The scope of a [<a>predeclared identifier</a>] is the universe block.</li>
	<li>The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable,
	    or function (but not method) declared at top level (outside any
	    function) is the package block.</li>
	<li>The scope of the package name of an imported package is the file block
	    of the file containing the import declaration.</li>
	<li>The scope of an identifier denoting a method receiver, function parameter,
	    or result variable is the function body.</li>
	<li>The scope of a constant or variable identifier declared
	    inside a function begins at the end of the ConstSpec or VarSpec
	    (ShortVarDecl for short variable declarations)
	    and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.</li>
	<li>The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function
	    begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec
	    and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.</li>
</ol><p>
An identifier declared in a block may be redeclared in an inner block.
While the identifier of the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes
the entity declared by the inner declaration.
</p><p>
The [<a>package clause</a>] is not a declaration; the package name
does not appear in any scope. Its purpose is to identify the files belonging
to the same [<a>package</a>] and to specify the default package name for import
declarations.
