Labels are declared by [<a>labeled statements</a>] and are
used in the [<a>&quot;break&quot;</a>],
[<a>&quot;continue&quot;</a>], and
[<a>&quot;goto&quot;</a>] statements.
It is illegal to define a label that is never used.
In contrast to other identifiers, labels are not block scoped and do
not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label
is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes
the body of any nested function.
