Within a package, package-level variable initialization proceeds stepwise,
with each step selecting the variable earliest in <i>declaration order</i>
which has no dependencies on uninitialized variables.
</p><p>
More precisely, a package-level variable is considered <i>ready for
initialization</i> if it is not yet initialized and either has
no [<a>initialization expression</a>] or
its initialization expression has no <i>dependencies</i> on uninitialized variables.
Initialization proceeds by repeatedly initializing the next package-level
variable that is earliest in declaration order and ready for initialization,
until there are no variables ready for initialization.
</p><p>
If any variables are still uninitialized when this
process ends, those variables are part of one or more initialization cycles,
and the program is not valid.
</p><p>
Multiple variables on the left-hand side of a variable declaration initialized
by single (multi-valued) expression on the right-hand side are initialized
together: If any of the variables on the left-hand side is initialized, all
those variables are initialized in the same step.
</p><pre>
var x = a
var a, b = f() // a and b are initialized together, before x is initialized
</pre><p>
For the purpose of package initialization, [<a>blank</a>]
variables are treated like any other variables in declarations.
</p><p>
The declaration order of variables declared in multiple files is determined
by the order in which the files are presented to the compiler: Variables
declared in the first file are declared before any of the variables declared
in the second file, and so on.
</p><p>
Dependency analysis does not rely on the actual values of the
variables, only on lexical <i>references</i> to them in the source,
analyzed transitively. For instance, if a variable <code>x</code>&apos;s
initialization expression refers to a function whose body refers to
variable <code>y</code> then <code>x</code> depends on <code>y</code>.
Specifically:
</p><ul>
<li>
A reference to a variable or function is an identifier denoting that
variable or function.
</li>
<li>
A reference to a method <code>m</code> is a
[<a>method value</a>] or
[<a>method expression</a>] of the form
<code>t.m</code>, where the (static) type of <code>t</code> is
not an interface type, and the method <code>m</code> is in the
[<a>method set</a>] of <code>t</code>.
It is immaterial whether the resulting function value
<code>t.m</code> is invoked.
</li>
<li>
A variable, function, or method <code>x</code> depends on a variable
<code>y</code> if <code>x</code>&apos;s initialization expression or body
(for functions and methods) contains a reference to <code>y</code>
or to a function or method that depends on <code>y</code>.
</li>
</ul><p>
For example, given the declarations
</p><pre>
var (
	a = c + b  // == 9
	b = f()    // == 4
	c = f()    // == 5
	d = 3      // == 5 after initialization has finished
)
func f() int {
	d++
	return d
}
</pre><p>
the initialization order is <code>d</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>a</code>.
Note that the order of subexpressions in initialization expressions is irrelevant:
<code>a = c + b</code> and <code>a = b + c</code> result in the same initialization
order in this example.
</p><p>
Dependency analysis is performed per package; only references referring
to variables, functions, and (non-interface) methods declared in the current
package are considered. If other, hidden, data dependencies exists between
variables, the initialization order between those variables is unspecified.
</p><p>
For instance, given the declarations
</p><pre>
var x = I(T{}).ab()   // x has an undetected, hidden dependency on a and b
var _ = sideEffect()  // unrelated to x, a, or b
var a = b
var b = 42
type I interface      { ab() []int }
type T struct{}
func (T) ab() []int   { return []int{a, b} }
</pre><p>
the variable <code>a</code> will be initialized after <code>b</code> but
whether <code>x</code> is initialized before <code>b</code>, between
<code>b</code> and <code>a</code>, or after <code>a</code>, and
thus also the moment at which <code>sideEffect()</code> is called (before
or after <code>x</code> is initialized) is not specified.
</p><p>
Variables may also be initialized using functions named <code>init</code>
declared in the package block, with no arguments and no result parameters.
</p><pre>
func init() { &#x2026; }
</pre><p>
Multiple such functions may be defined per package, even within a single
source file. In the package block, the <code>init</code> identifier can
be used only to declare <code>init</code> functions, yet the identifier
itself is not [<a>declared</a>]. Thus
<code>init</code> functions cannot be referred to from anywhere
in a program.
</p><p>
A package with no imports is initialized by assigning initial values
to all its package-level variables followed by calling all <code>init</code>
functions in the order they appear in the source, possibly in multiple files,
as presented to the compiler.
If a package has imports, the imported packages are initialized
before initializing the package itself. If multiple packages import
a package, the imported package will be initialized only once.
The importing of packages, by construction, guarantees that there
can be no cyclic initialization dependencies.
</p><p>
Package initialization&#x2014;variable initialization and the invocation of
<code>init</code> functions&#x2014;happens in a single goroutine,
sequentially, one package at a time.
An <code>init</code> function may launch other goroutines, which can run
concurrently with the initialization code. However, initialization
always sequences
the <code>init</code> functions: it will not invoke the next one
until the previous one has returned.
</p><p>
To ensure reproducible initialization behavior, build systems are encouraged
to present multiple files belonging to the same package in lexical file name
order to a compiler.
