A type may have a <i>method set</i> associated with it.
The method set of an [<a>interface type</a>] is its interface.
The method set of any other type <code>T</code> consists of all
[<a>methods</a>] declared with receiver type <code>T</code>.
The method set of the corresponding [<a>pointer type</a>] <code>*T</code>
is the set of all methods declared with receiver <code>*T</code> or <code>T</code>
(that is, it also contains the method set of <code>T</code>).
Further rules apply to structs containing embedded fields, as described
in the section on [<a>struct types</a>].
Any other type has an empty method set.
In a method set, each method must have a
[<a>unique</a>]
non-[<a>blank</a>] [<a>method name</a>].
</p><p>
The method set of a type determines the interfaces that the
type [<a>implements</a>]
and the methods that can be [<a>called</a>]
using a receiver of that type.
