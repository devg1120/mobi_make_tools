Constant expressions may contain only [<a>constant</a>]
operands and are evaluated at compile time.
</p><p>
Untyped boolean, numeric, and string constants may be used as operands
wherever it is legal to use an operand of boolean, numeric, or string type,
respectively.
</p><p>
A constant [<a>comparison</a>] always yields
an untyped boolean constant.  If the left operand of a constant
[<a>shift expression</a>] is an untyped constant, the
result is an integer constant; otherwise it is a constant of the same
type as the left operand, which must be of
[<a>integer type</a>].
</p><p>
Any other operation on untyped constants results in an untyped constant of the
same kind; that is, a boolean, integer, floating-point, complex, or string
constant.
If the untyped operands of a binary operation (other than a shift) are of
different kinds, the result is of the operand&apos;s kind that appears later in this
list: integer, rune, floating-point, complex.
For example, an untyped integer constant divided by an
untyped complex constant yields an untyped complex constant.
</p><pre>
const a = 2 + 3.0          // a == 5.0   (untyped floating-point constant)
const b = 15 / 4           // b == 3     (untyped integer constant)
const c = 15 / 4.0         // c == 3.75  (untyped floating-point constant)
const &#x398; float64 = 3/2      // &#x398; == 1.0   (type float64, 3/2 is integer division)
const &#x3A0; float64 = 3/2.     // &#x3A0; == 1.5   (type float64, 3/2. is float division)
const d = 1 &lt;&lt; 3.0         // d == 8     (untyped integer constant)
const e = 1.0 &lt;&lt; 3         // e == 8     (untyped integer constant)
const f = int32(1) &lt;&lt; 33   // illegal    (constant 8589934592 overflows int32)
const g = float64(2) &gt;&gt; 1  // illegal    (float64(2) is a typed floating-point constant)
const h = &quot;foo&quot; &gt; &quot;bar&quot;    // h == true  (untyped boolean constant)
const j = true             // j == true  (untyped boolean constant)
const k = &apos;w&apos; + 1          // k == &apos;x&apos;   (untyped rune constant)
const l = &quot;hi&quot;             // l == &quot;hi&quot;  (untyped string constant)
const m = string(k)        // m == &quot;x&quot;   (type string)
const &#x3A3; = 1 - 0.707i       //            (untyped complex constant)
const &#x394; = &#x3A3; + 2.0e-4       //            (untyped complex constant)
const &#x3A6; = iota*1i - 1/1i   //            (untyped complex constant)
</pre><p>
Applying the built-in function <code>complex</code> to untyped
integer, rune, or floating-point constants yields
an untyped complex constant.
</p><pre>
const ic = complex(0, c)   // ic == 3.75i  (untyped complex constant)
const i&#x398; = complex(0, &#x398;)   // i&#x398; == 1i     (type complex128)
</pre><p>
Constant expressions are always evaluated exactly; intermediate values and the
constants themselves may require precision significantly larger than supported
by any predeclared type in the language. The following are legal declarations:
</p><pre>
const Huge = 1 &lt;&lt; 100         // Huge == 1267650600228229401496703205376  (untyped integer constant)
const Four int8 = Huge &gt;&gt; 98  // Four == 4                                (type int8)
</pre><p>
The divisor of a constant division or remainder operation must not be zero:
</p><pre>
3.14 / 0.0   // illegal: division by zero
</pre><p>
The values of <i>typed</i> constants must always be accurately
[<a>representable</a>] by values
of the constant type. The following constant expressions are illegal:
</p><pre>
uint(-1)     // -1 cannot be represented as a uint
int(3.14)    // 3.14 cannot be represented as an int
int64(Huge)  // 1267650600228229401496703205376 cannot be represented as an int64
Four * 300   // operand 300 cannot be represented as an int8 (type of Four)
Four * 100   // product 400 cannot be represented as an int8 (type of Four)
</pre><p>
The mask used by the unary bitwise complement operator <code>^</code> matches
the rule for non-constants: the mask is all 1s for unsigned constants
and -1 for signed and untyped constants.
</p><pre>
^1         // untyped integer constant, equal to -2
uint8(^1)  // illegal: same as uint8(-2), -2 cannot be represented as a uint8
^uint8(1)  // typed uint8 constant, same as 0xFF ^ uint8(1) = uint8(0xFE)
int8(^1)   // same as int8(-2)
^int8(1)   // same as -1 ^ int8(1) = -2
</pre><p>
Implementation restriction: A compiler may use rounding while
computing untyped floating-point or complex constant expressions; see
the implementation restriction in the section
on [<a>constants</a>].  This rounding may cause a
floating-point constant expression to be invalid in an integer
context, even if it would be integral when calculated using infinite
precision, and vice versa.
