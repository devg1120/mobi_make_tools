Arithmetic operators apply to numeric values and yield a result of the same
type as the first operand. The four standard arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>) apply to integer,
floating-point, and complex types; <code>+</code> also applies to strings.
The bitwise logical and shift operators apply to integers only.
</p><pre>
+    sum                    integers, floats, complex values, strings
-    difference             integers, floats, complex values
*    product                integers, floats, complex values
/    quotient               integers, floats, complex values
%    remainder              integers
&amp;    bitwise AND            integers
|    bitwise OR             integers
^    bitwise XOR            integers
&amp;^   bit clear (AND NOT)    integers
&lt;&lt;   left shift             integer &lt;&lt; unsigned integer
&gt;&gt;   right shift            integer &gt;&gt; unsigned integer
</pre><h4>Integer operators</h4><p>
For two integer values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, the integer quotient
<code>q = x / y</code> and remainder <code>r = x % y</code> satisfy the following
relationships:
</p><pre>
x = q*y + r  and  |r| &lt; |y|
</pre><p>
with <code>x / y</code> truncated towards zero
([<a>&quot;truncated division&quot;</a>]).
</p><pre>
 x     y     x / y     x % y
 5     3       1         2
-5     3      -1        -2
 5    -3      -1         2
-5    -3       1        -2
</pre><p>
The one exception to this rule is that if the dividend <code>x</code> is
the most negative value for the int type of <code>x</code>, the quotient
<code>q = x / -1</code> is equal to <code>x</code> (and <code>r = 0</code>)
due to two&apos;s-complement [<a>integer overflow</a>]:
</p><pre>
			 x, q
int8                     -128
int16                  -32768
int32             -2147483648
int64    -9223372036854775808
</pre><p>
If the divisor is a [<a>constant</a>], it must not be zero.
If the divisor is zero at run time, a [<a>run-time panic</a>] occurs.
If the dividend is non-negative and the divisor is a constant power of 2,
the division may be replaced by a right shift, and computing the remainder may
be replaced by a bitwise AND operation:
</p><pre>
 x     x / 4     x % 4     x &gt;&gt; 2     x &amp; 3
 11      2         3         2          3
-11     -2        -3        -3          1
</pre><p>
The shift operators shift the left operand by the shift count specified by the
right operand, which must be positive. If the shift count is negative at run time,
a [<a>run-time panic</a>] occurs.
The shift operators implement arithmetic shifts if the left operand is a signed
integer and logical shifts if it is an unsigned integer.
There is no upper limit on the shift count. Shifts behave
as if the left operand is shifted <code>n</code> times by 1 for a shift
count of <code>n</code>.
As a result, <code>x &lt;&lt; 1</code> is the same as <code>x*2</code>
and <code>x &gt;&gt; 1</code> is the same as
<code>x/2</code> but truncated towards negative infinity.
</p><p>
For integer operands, the unary operators
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>^</code> are defined as
follows:
</p><pre>
+x                          is 0 + x
-x    negation              is 0 - x
^x    bitwise complement    is m ^ x  with m = &quot;all bits set to 1&quot; for unsigned x
                                      and  m = -1 for signed x
</pre><h4>Integer overflow</h4><p>
For unsigned integer values, the operations <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> are
computed modulo 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, where <i>n</i> is the bit width of
the [<a>unsigned integer</a>]&apos;s type.
Loosely speaking, these unsigned integer operations
discard high bits upon overflow, and programs may rely on &quot;wrap around&quot;.
</p><p>
For signed integers, the operations <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> may legally
overflow and the resulting value exists and is deterministically defined
by the signed integer representation, the operation, and its operands.
Overflow does not cause a [<a>run-time panic</a>].
A compiler may not optimize code under the assumption that overflow does
not occur. For instance, it may not assume that <code>x &lt; x + 1</code> is always true.
</p><h4>Floating-point operators</h4><p>
For floating-point and complex numbers,
<code>+x</code> is the same as <code>x</code>,
while <code>-x</code> is the negation of <code>x</code>.
The result of a floating-point or complex division by zero is not specified beyond the
IEEE-754 standard; whether a [<a>run-time panic</a>]
occurs is implementation-specific.
</p><p>
An implementation may combine multiple floating-point operations into a single
fused operation, possibly across statements, and produce a result that differs
from the value obtained by executing and rounding the instructions individually.
An explicit floating-point type [<a>conversion</a>] rounds to
the precision of the target type, preventing fusion that would discard that rounding.
</p><p>
For instance, some architectures provide a &quot;fused multiply and add&quot; (FMA) instruction
that computes <code>x*y + z</code> without rounding the intermediate result <code>x*y</code>.
These examples show when a Go implementation can use that instruction:
</p><pre>
// FMA allowed for computing r, because x*y is not explicitly rounded:
r  = x*y + z
r  = z;   r += x*y
t  = x*y; r = t + z
*p = x*y; r = *p + z
r  = x*y + float64(z)
// FMA disallowed for computing r, because it would omit rounding of x*y:
r  = float64(x*y) + z
r  = z; r += float64(x*y)
t  = float64(x*y); r = t + z
</pre><h4>String concatenation</h4><p>
Strings can be concatenated using the <code>+</code> operator
or the <code>+=</code> assignment operator:
</p><pre>
s := &quot;hi&quot; + string(c)
s += &quot; and good bye&quot;
</pre><p>
String addition creates a new string by concatenating the operands.
