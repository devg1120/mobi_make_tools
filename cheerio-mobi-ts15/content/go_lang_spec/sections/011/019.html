For an operand <code>ch</code> of [<a>channel type</a>],
the value of the receive operation <code><-ch< code> is the value received
from the channel <code>ch</code>. The channel direction must permit receive operations,
and the type of the receive operation is the element type of the channel.
The expression blocks until a value is available.
Receiving from a <code>nil</code> channel blocks forever.
A receive operation on a [<a>closed</a>] channel can always proceed
immediately, yielding the element type&apos;s [<a>zero value</a>]
after any previously sent values have been received.

A receive expression used in an [<a>assignment</a>] or initialization of the special form
</p><pre>
x, ok = <-ch x, ok :="&lt;-ch" var t="&lt;-ch" < pre><p>
yields an additional untyped boolean result reporting whether the
communication succeeded. The value of <code>ok</code> is <code>true</code>
if the value received was delivered by a successful send operation to the
channel, or <code>false</code> if it is a zero value generated because the
channel is closed and empty.
