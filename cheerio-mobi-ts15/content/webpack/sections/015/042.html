<h3 id="module-paths">Module paths<a href="#module-paths" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h3>
<pre><code class="hljs language-js"><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">&apos;module&apos;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">&apos;module/lib/file&apos;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>Modules are searched for inside all directories specified in <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolvemodules"><code>resolve.modules</code></a>.
    You can replace the original module path by an alternate path by creating an alias for it using the <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias"><code>resolve.alias</code></a> configuration option.</p>
<p>Once the path is resolved based on the above rule, the resolver checks to see if the path points to a file or a directory. If the path points to a file:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the path has a file extension, then the file is bundled straightaway.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, the file extension is resolved using the <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions"><code>resolve.extensions</code></a> option, which tells the resolver which extensions are acceptable for resolution e.g. <code>.js</code>, <code>.jsx</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the path points to a folder, then the following steps are taken to find the right file with the right extension:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the folder contains a <code>package.json</code> file, then fields specified in <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfields"><code>resolve.mainFields</code></a> configuration option are looked up in order, and the first such field in <code>package.json</code> determines the file path.</li>
    <li>If there is no <code>package.json</code> or if the <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfields"><code>resolve.mainFields</code></a> do not return a valid path, file names specified in the <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfiles"><code>resolve.mainFiles</code></a> configuration option are looked for in order, to see if a matching filename exists in the imported/required directory .</li>
    <li>The file extension is then resolved in a similar way using the <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions"><code>resolve.extensions</code></a> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>webpack provides reasonable <a href="/configuration/resolve">defaults</a> for these options depending on your build target.</p>
<h2 id="resolving-loaders-1">Resolving Loaders<a href="#resolving-loaders-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>This follows the same rules as those specified for file resolution. But the <a href="/configuration/resolve/#resolveloader"><code>resolveLoader</code></a> configuration option can be used to have separate resolution rules for loaders.</p>
<h2 id="caching">Caching<a href="#caching" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>Every filesystem access is cached, so that multiple parallel or serial requests to the same file occur faster. In <a href="/configuration/watch/#watch">watch mode</a>, only modified files are evicted from the cache. If watch mode is off, then the cache gets purged before every compilation.</p>
<p>See <a href="/configuration/resolve">Resolve API</a> to learn more on the configuration options mentioned above.</p>
<h1 id="dependency-graph">Dependency Graph<a href="#dependency-graph" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h1>
<p>Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a <em>dependency</em>. This allows webpack to take non-code assets, such as images or web fonts, and also provide them as <em>dependencies</em> for your application.</p>
<p>When webpack processes your application, it starts from a list of modules defined on the command line or in its config file.
    Starting from these <a href="/concepts/entry-points/"><em>entry points</em></a>, webpack recursively builds a <em>dependency graph</em> that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of <em>bundles</em> - often, just one - to be loaded by the browser.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">
    <p>Bundling your application is especially powerful for <em>HTTP/1.1</em> clients, as it minimizes the number of times your app has to wait while the browser starts a new request. For <em>HTTP/2</em>, you can also use <a href="/guides/code-splitting/">Code Splitting</a> to achieve best results.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="targets">Targets<a href="#targets" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h1>
<p>Because JavaScript can be written for both server and browser, webpack offers multiple deployment <em>targets</em> that you can set in your webpack <a href="/configuration">configuration</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="warning">
    <p>The webpack <code>target</code> property is not to be confused with the <code>output.libraryTarget</code> property. For more information see <a href="/concepts/output/">our guide</a> on the <code>output</code> property.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="usage-2">Usage<a href="#usage-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>To set the <code>target</code> property, you simply set the target value in your webpack config:</p>
<p><strong>webpack.config.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">module<span class="token punctuation">.</span>exports <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  target<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">&apos;node&apos;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>In the example above, using <code>node</code> webpack will compile for usage in a Node.js-like environment (uses Node.js <code>require</code> to load chunks and not touch any built in modules like <code>fs</code> or <code>path</code>).</p>
<p>Each <em>target</em> has a variety of deployment/environment specific additions, support to fit its needs. See what <a href="/configuration/target/">targets are available</a>.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-targets-1">Multiple Targets<a href="#multiple-targets-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>Although webpack does <strong>not</strong> support multiple strings being passed into the <code>target</code> property, you can create an isomorphic library by bundling two separate configurations:</p>
<p><strong>webpack.config.js</strong></p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>As seen from the options above, there are multiple deployment <em>targets</em> that you can choose from. Below is a list of examples and resources that you can refer to.</p>

<h1 id="the-manifest">The Manifest<a href="#the-manifest" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h1>
<p>In a typical application or site built with webpack, there are three main types of code:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The source code you, and maybe your team, have written.</li>
    <li>Any third-party library or &quot;vendor&quot; code your source is dependent on.</li>
    <li>A webpack runtime and <strong>manifest</strong> that conducts the interaction of all modules.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will focus on the last of these three parts: the runtime and, in particular, the manifest.</p>
<h2 id="runtime">Runtime<a href="#runtime" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>The runtime, along with the manifest data, is basically all the code webpack needs to connect your modularized application while it&apos;s running in the browser. It contains the loading and resolving logic needed to connect your modules as they interact. This includes connecting modules that have already been loaded into the browser as well as logic to lazy-load the ones that haven&apos;t.</p>
<h2 id="manifest">Manifest<a href="#manifest" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>Once your application hits the browser in the form of <code>index.html</code> file, some bundles and a variety of other assets required by your application must be loaded and linked somehow. That <code>/src</code> directory you meticulously laid out is now bundled, minified and maybe even split into smaller chunks for lazy-loading by webpack&apos;s <a href="/configuration/optimization/"><code>optimization</code></a>. So how does webpack manage the interaction between all of your required modules? This is where the manifest data comes in...</p>
<p>As the compiler enters, resolves, and maps out your application, it keeps detailed notes on all your modules. This collection of data is called the &quot;Manifest,&quot; and it&apos;s what the runtime will use to resolve and load modules once they&apos;ve been bundled and shipped to the browser. No matter which <a href="/api/module-methods">module syntax</a> you have chosen, those <code>import</code> or <code>require</code> statements have now become <code>__webpack_require__</code> methods that point to module identifiers. Using the data in the manifest, the runtime will be able to find out where to retrieve the modules behind the identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem<a href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>So now you have a little bit of insight about how webpack works behind the scenes. &quot;But, how does this affect me?&quot;, you might ask. The simple answer is that most of the time it doesn&apos;t. The runtime will do its thing, utilizing the manifest, and everything will appear to just magically work once your application hits the browser. However, if you decide to improve the performance of your projects by utilizing browser caching, this process will all of a sudden become an important thing to understand.</p>
<p>By using content hashes within your bundle file names, you can indicate to the browser when the content of a file has changed, thus invalidating the cache. Once you start doing this though, you&apos;ll immediately notice some funny behavior. Certain hashes change even when their content apparently does not. This is caused by the injection of the runtime and manifest, which changes every build.</p>
<p>See <a href="/guides/output-management/#the-manifest">the manifest section</a> of our <em>Output management</em> guide to learn how to extract the manifest, and read the guides below to learn more about the intricacies of long term caching.</p>
<h1 id="hot-module-replacement">Hot Module Replacement<a href="#hot-module-replacement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h1>
<p>Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes <a href="/concepts/modules/">modules</a> while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.</li>
    <li>Save valuable development time by only updating what&apos;s changed.</li>
    <li>Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser&apos;s dev tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>Let&apos;s go through some different viewpoints to understand exactly how HMR works...</p>
