<p>Here things get a bit more technical... if you&apos;re not interested in the internals, feel free to jump to the <a href="/api/hot-module-replacement">HMR API page</a> or <a href="/guides/hot-module-replacement">HMR guide</a>.</p>
<p>For the module system runtime, additional code is emitted to track module <code>parents</code> and <code>children</code>. On the management side, the runtime supports two methods: <code>check</code> and <code>apply</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>check</code> makes an HTTP request to the update manifest. If this request fails, there is no update available. If it succeeds, the list of updated chunks is compared to the list of currently loaded chunks. For each loaded chunk, the corresponding update chunk is downloaded. All module updates are stored in the runtime. When all update chunks have been downloaded and are ready to be applied, the runtime switches into the <code>ready</code> state.</p>
<p>The <code>apply</code> method flags all updated modules as invalid. For each invalid module, there needs to be an update handler in the module or in its parent(s). Otherwise, the invalid flag bubbles up and invalidates parent(s) as well. Each bubble continues until the app&apos;s entry point or a module with an update handler is reached (whichever comes first). If it bubbles up from an entry point, the process fails.</p>
<p>Afterwards, all invalid modules are disposed (via the dispose handler) and unloaded. The current hash is then updated and all <code>accept</code> handlers are called. The runtime switches back to the <code>idle</code> state and everything continues as normal.</p>

<p>HMR can be used in development as a LiveReload replacement. <a href="/configuration/dev-server/">webpack-dev-server</a> supports a <code>hot</code> mode in which it tries to update with HMR before trying to reload the whole page. See the <a href="/guides/hot-module-replacement">Hot Module Replacement guide</a> for details.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">
    <p>As with many other features, webpack&apos;s power lies in its customizability. There are <em>many</em> ways of configuring HMR depending on the needs of a particular project. However, for most purposes, <code>webpack-dev-server</code> is a good fit and will allow you to get started with HMR quickly.</p>

<h1 id="why-webpack">Why webpack<a href="#why-webpack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h1>
<p>To understand why you should use webpack, let&apos;s recap how we used JavaScript on the web before bundlers were a thing.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run JavaScript in a browser. First, include a script for each functionality; this solution is hard to scale because loading too many scripts can cause a network bottleneck. The second option is to use a big <code>.js</code> file containing all your project code, but this leads to problems in scope, size, readability and maintainability.</p>
<h2 id="iifes---immediately-invoked-function-expressions">IIFE&apos;s - Immediately invoked function expressions<a href="#iifes---immediately-invoked-function-expressions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>IIFEs solve scoping issues for large projects; when script files are wrapped by an IIFE, you can safely concatenate or safely combine files without worrying about scope collision.</p>
<p>The use of IIFEs led to tools like Make, Gulp, Grunt, Broccoli or Brunch. These tools are known as task runners, and they concatenate all your project files together.</p>
<p>However, changing one file means you have to rebuild the whole thing. Concatenating makes it easy to reuse scripts across files but makes build optimizations more difficult. How can you find out if code is actually being used or not?</p>
<p>Even if you only use a single function from lodash, you have to add the entire library and then squish it together. How do you treeshake the dependencies on your code? Lazy loading chunks of code can be hard to do at scale and requires a lot of manual work from the developer.</p>

<p>webpack runs on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that can be used in computers and servers outside a browser environment.</p>
<p>When Node.js was released a new era started, and it came with new challenges. Now that JavaScript is not running in a browser, how are Node applications supposed to load new chunks of code? There are no html files and script tags that can be added to it.</p>
<p>CommonJS came out and introduced <code>require</code>, which allows you to load and use a module in the current file. This solved scope issues out of the box by importing each module as it was needed.</p>
<h2 id="npm--nodejs--modules----mass-distribution">npm + Node.js + modules -- mass distribution<a href="#npm--nodejs--modules----mass-distribution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>JavaScript is taking over the world as a language, as a platform and as a way to rapidly develop and create fast applications.</p>
<p>But there is no browser support for CommonJS. There are no <a href="https://medium.com/webpack/the-state-of-javascript-modules-4636d1774358">live bindings</a>. There are problems with circular references. Synchronous module resolution and loading is slow. While CommonJS was a great solution for Node.js projects, browsers didn&apos;t support modules, so bundlers and tools like Browserify, RequireJS and SystemJS were created, allowing us to write CommonJS modules that run in a browser.</p>
<h2 id="esm---ecmascript-modules">ESM - ECMAScript Modules<a href="#esm---ecmascript-modules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>The good news for web projects is that modules are becoming an official feature in the ECMAScript standard. However, browser support is incomplete and bundling is still faster and currently recommended over these early module implementations.</p>
<h2 id="wouldnt-it-be-nice">Wouldn&apos;t it be nice&#x2026;<a href="#wouldnt-it-be-nice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>
<p>...to have something that will not only let us write modules but also support any module format (at least until we get to ESM) and handle resources and assets at the same time?</p>
<p>This is why webpack exists. It&apos;s a tool that lets you bundle your JavaScript applications (supporting both ESM and CommonJS), and it can be extended to support many different assets such as images, fonts and stylesheets.</p>
<p>webpack cares about performance and load times; it&apos;s always improving or adding new features, such as async chunk loading and prefetching, to deliver the best possible experience for your project and your users.</p>
