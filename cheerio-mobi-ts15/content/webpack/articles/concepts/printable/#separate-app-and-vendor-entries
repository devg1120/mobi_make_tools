    <p>In webpack version &lt; 4 it was common to add vendors as a separate entry point to compile it as a separate file (in combination with the <code>CommonsChunkPlugin</code>). <br><br> This is discouraged in webpack 4. Instead, the <a href="/configuration/optimization/#optimizationsplitchunks"><code>optimization.splitChunks</code></a> option takes care of separating vendors and app modules and creating a separate file. <strong>Do not</strong> create an entry for vendors or other stuff that is not the starting point of execution.</p>
