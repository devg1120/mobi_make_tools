<p>HMR can be used in development as a LiveReload replacement. <a href="/configuration/dev-server/">webpack-dev-server</a> supports a <code>hot</code> mode in which it tries to update with HMR before trying to reload the whole page. See the <a href="/guides/hot-module-replacement">Hot Module Replacement guide</a> for details.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">
    <p>As with many other features, webpack&apos;s power lies in its customizability. There are <em>many</em> ways of configuring HMR depending on the needs of a particular project. However, for most purposes, <code>webpack-dev-server</code> is a good fit and will allow you to get started with HMR quickly.</p>

<p>To understand why you should use webpack, let&apos;s recap how we used JavaScript on the web before bundlers were a thing.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run JavaScript in a browser. First, include a script for each functionality; this solution is hard to scale because loading too many scripts can cause a network bottleneck. The second option is to use a big <code>.js</code> file containing all your project code, but this leads to problems in scope, size, readability and maintainability.</p>
