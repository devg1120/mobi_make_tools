<p>As seen from the options above, there are multiple deployment <em>targets</em> that you can choose from. Below is a list of examples and resources that you can refer to.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheLarkInn/compare-webpack-target-bundles">compare-webpack-target-bundles</a></strong>: A great resource for testing and viewing different webpack <em>targets</em>. Also great for bug reporting.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate">Boilerplate of Electron-React Application</a></strong>: A good example of a build process for electron&apos;s main process and renderer process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="todo">
    <p>Need to find up to date examples of these webpack targets being used in live code or boilerplates.</p>

<h1 id="the-manifest">The Manifest<a href="#the-manifest" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h1>
<p>In a typical application or site built with webpack, there are three main types of code:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The source code you, and maybe your team, have written.</li>
    <li>Any third-party library or &quot;vendor&quot; code your source is dependent on.</li>
    <li>A webpack runtime and <strong>manifest</strong> that conducts the interaction of all modules.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will focus on the last of these three parts: the runtime and, in particular, the manifest.</p>
