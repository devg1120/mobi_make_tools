      <p>In the most general sense, Subversion handles binary files
      more gracefully than CVS does.  Because CVS uses RCS, it can
      only store successive full copies of a changing binary file.
      Subversion, however, expresses differences between files using a
      binary differencing algorithm, regardless of whether they
      contain textual or binary data.  That means all files are
      stored differentially (compressed) in the repository.</p>
      <p>CVS users have to mark binary files with
      <code class="option">-kb</code> flags to prevent data from being
      garbled (due to keyword expansion and line-ending translations).
      They sometimes forget to do this.</p>
      <p>Subversion takes the more paranoid route.  First, it never
      performs any kind of keyword or line-ending translation unless
      you explicitly ask it to do so (see
      <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html" title="Keyword Substitution">the section called “Keyword Substitution”</a> and
      <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style" title="End-of-Line Character Sequences">the section called “End-of-Line Character Sequences”</a> for more
      details).  By default, Subversion treats all file data as
      literal byte strings, and files are always stored in the
      repository in an untranslated state.</p>
      <p>Second, Subversion maintains an internal notion of whether a
      file is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">binary</span>”</span> data, but
      this notion is <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> extant in the working
      copy.  During an <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, Subversion will
      perform contextual merges on locally modified text files, but
      will not attempt to do so for binary files.</p>
      <p>To determine whether a contextual merge is possible,
      Subversion examines the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
      property.  If the file has no <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
      property, or has a MIME type that is textual (e.g.,
      <code class="literal">text/*</code>),
      Subversion assumes it is text.  Otherwise, Subversion assumes
      the file is binary.  Subversion also helps users by running a
      binary-detection algorithm in the <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span>
      and <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> commands.  These commands will
      make a good guess and then (possibly) set a binary
      <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on the file being
      added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, the user can always remove
      or hand-edit the property.)</p>
