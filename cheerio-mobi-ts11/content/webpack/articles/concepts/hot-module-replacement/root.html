<h1>Hot Module Replacement</h1>
<p>Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes <a href="/concepts/modules/">modules</a> while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.</li>
    <li>Save valuable development time by only updating what&apos;s changed.</li>
    <li>Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser&apos;s dev tools.</li>
</ul>
