    <p>Unix&apos;s durability and its technical culture are certainly of
        interest to people who already like Unix, and perhaps to historians of
        technology. But Unix&apos;s original application as a general-purpose
        timesharing system for mid-sized and larger computers is rapidly
        receding into the mists of history, killed off by personal
        workstations. And there is certainly room for doubt that it will ever
        achieve success in the mainstream business-desktop market now
        dominated by
        Microsoft.</p>
    <p>Outsiders have frequently dismissed Unix as an academic toy or a
        hacker&apos;s sandbox. One well-known polemic, the <i>Unix Hater&apos;s
            Handbook</i> [<a href="apb.html#Garfinkel" title="[Garfinkel]">Garfinkel</a>], follows an
        antagonistic line nearly as old as Unix itself in writing its devotees
        off as a cult religion of freaks and losers. Certainly the colossal
        and repeated blunders of
        AT&amp;T</p>
    <p>Even from within the Unix world, Unix has seemed to be teetering
        on the brink of universality for so long as to raise the suspicion
        that it will never actually get there. A skeptical outside observer&apos;s
        conclusion might be that Unix is too useful to die but too awkward to
        break out of the back room; a perpetual niche operating&#xFFFD;system.</p>
    <p>What confounds the skeptics&apos; case is, more than anything else,
        the rise of Linux</p>
