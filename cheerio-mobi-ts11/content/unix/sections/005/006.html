    <p>Modularity is expressed in good code, but it primarily comes
        from good design. Here are some questions to ask about any code you
        work on that might help you improve its modularity:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>How many global variables does it have? Global variables are
                    modularity poison, an easy way for components to leak information to
                    each other in careless and promiscuous ways.<sup>[<a id="id2900865" href="ch04s06.html#ftn.id2900865">48</a>]</sup></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is the size of your individual modules in Hatton&apos;s sweet spot? If your
                    answer is &#x201C;No, many are larger&#x201D;, you may have a long-term
                    maintenance problem. Do you know what your own sweet spot is? Do
                    you know what it is for other programmers you are cooperating with?
                    If not, best be conservative and stick to sizes near the low end of
                    Hatton&apos;s range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Are the individual functions in your modules too large? This
                    is not so much a matter of line count as it is of internal complexity. If you
                    can&apos;t informally describe a function&apos;s contract with its callers in
                    one line, the function is probably too large.<sup>[<a id="id2900903" href="ch04s06.html#ftn.id2900903">49</a>]</sup></p>

                                <p>Personally I tend to break up a subprogram when there are too many
                                    local variables. Another clue is [too many] levels of indentation.
                                    I rarely look at length.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Does your code have internal APIs &#x2014; that is, collections
                    of function calls and data structures that you can describe to others
                    as units, each sealing off some layer of function from the rest of the
                    code? A good API makes sense and is understandable without looking at
                    the implementation behind it. The classic test is this: Try to
                    describe it to another programmer over the phone. If you fail, it
                    is very probably too complex, and poorly designed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Do any of your APIs have more than seven entry points? Do any
                    of your classes have more than seven methods each? Do your data
                    structures have more than seven members?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What is the distribution of the number of entry points per
                    module across the project?<sup>[<a id="id2900990" href="ch04s06.html#ftn.id2900990">50</a>]</sup>
                    Does it seem uneven? Do the modules with lots of entry points really
                    need that many? Module complexity tends to rise as the square of the
                    number of entry points, too &#x2014; yet another reason simple APIs are
                    better than complicated&#xFFFD;ones.</p>
