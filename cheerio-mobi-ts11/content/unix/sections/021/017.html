    <p>A Unix zealot, having heard that Master Foo was wise in the
        Great Way, came to him for instruction. Master Foo said to him:</p>
    <p>&#x201C;When the Patriarch Thompson invented Unix, he did not
        understand it. Then he gained in understanding, and no longer invented
        it&#x201D;.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;When the Patriarch McIlroy invented the pipe, he knew
        that it would transform software, but did not know that it would
        transform mind&#x201D;.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;When the Patriarch Ritchie invented C, he condemned
        programmers to a thousand hells of buffer overruns, heap corruption,
        and stale-pointer bugs&#x201D;.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;Truly, the Patriarchs were blind and foolish!&#x201D;</p>
    <p>The zealot was greatly angered by the Master&apos;s words.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;These enlightened ones&#x201D;, he protested. &#x201C;gave
        us the Great Way of Unix. Surely, if we mock them we will lose merit
        and be reborn as beasts or MCSEs&#x201D;.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;Is your code ever completely without stain and
        flaw?&#x201D; demanded Master Foo.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;No&#x201D;, admitted the zealot, &#x201C;no man&apos;s
        is&#x201D;.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;The wisdom of the Patriarchs&#x201D;, said Master Foo,
        &#x201C;was that they <span class="emphasis"><em>knew</em></span> they were
        fools&#x201D;.</p>
    <p>Upon hearing this, the zealot was enlightened.</p>
