    <p>To facilitate scripting and pipelining (see <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a>) it is wise to choose the
        simplest interface pattern possible &#x2014; that is, the pattern with the
        fewest channels to the environment and the least
        interactivity.</p>
    <p>In many of the single-component patterns described above, it is
        emphasized that the pattern does not require user interaction after
        startup time. When the &#x2018;user&#x2019; is often expected to be another
        program (and thus to lack the range and flexibility of a human
        brain) this is a very valuable feature, maximizing
        scriptability.</p>
    <p>We&apos;ve seen that different interface design patterns optimize for
        traits valuable in differing circumstances. In particular, there is
        a strong and inherent tension between the GUIs and design patterns
        appropriate for novice and nontechnical end-users (on the one
        hand) and those which serve expert users and maximize scriptability
        (on the other).</p>
    <p>One way around this dilemma is to make programs with modes that
        exhibit more than one pattern. An excellent example is the Web browser
        lynx(1). It
        normally has a roguelike interface for interactive use, but can be
        called with a <tt>-dump</tt> option that makes it into a
        source, formatting a specified Web page to text dumped on standard
        output.</p>
    <p>Such dual-mode interfaces, however, are not normally attempted
        when the program has to have a true GUI. The reasons for this are
        partly historical, but mostly have to do with controlling global
        complexity. GUIs tend to require complex startup configurations and
        large volumes of specialized code; these features coexist uneasily
        with the simpler patterns. In the worst case, a dual-mode GUI/non-GUI
        program could require two separate command-interpreter loops, with
        all that implies in the way of code bloat and potential
        inconsistencies.</p>
    <p>Thus, when &#x201C;choose the simplest pattern&#x201D; conflicts
        with a requirement to produce a GUI, the Unix way is to split the
        program in two, applying the &#x2018;separated engine and
        interface&#x2019; design pattern.</p>
    <p>In fact, by combining a theme from <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a> with this idea, we can perhaps name a
        new design pattern emerging under Linux</p>

        <p>A polyvalent program has the following traits:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">

                    <p>
                        The program&apos;s application-domain logic lives in a library with a
                        documented API, which can be linked to other programs. The program&apos;s
                        interface logic to the rest of the world is a thin layer over the
                        library. Or perhaps there are several layers with different UI
                        styles, any of which the library can be linked to.
                    </p>

                        One UI mode is a cantrip, compiler-like or CLI pattern that executes its
                        interactive commands in batch mode.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> One UI mode is a GUI, either linked directly to the
                        core library or acting as as a separate process driving the CLI
                        interface. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> One UI mode is a scripting interface using a modern
                        general-purpose scripting language like
                        Perl</p>

                <li>
                    <p> Optional extra: One UI mode is a roguelike interface
                        using
                        curses(3).
