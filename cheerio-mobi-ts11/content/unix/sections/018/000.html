                    </span></i></span></div>
    <p>Unix was the first production operating system to be ported
        between differing processor families (Version 6 Unix, 1976-77). Today,
        Unix is routinely ported to every new machine powerful enough to sport
        a memory-management unit. Unix applications are routinely moved
        between Unixes running on wildly differing hardware; in fact, it is
        unheard of for a port to fail.</p>
    <p>Portability has always been one of Unix&apos;s principal advantages.
        Unix programmers tend to write on the assumption that hardware is
        evanescent and only the Unix API is stable, making as few assumptions
        as possible about machine specifics such as word length, endianness or
        memory architecture. In fact, code that is hardware-dependent in any
        way that goes beyond the abstract machine model of
        C</p>
    <p>Unix programmers have learned that it is easy to be wrong when
        anticipating that a software project will have a short
        lifetime.<sup>[<a id="id2998082" href="portabilitychapter.html#ftn.id2998082">141</a>]</sup> Thus, they
        tend to avoid making software dependent on specific and perishable
        technologies, and to lean heavily on open standards. These habits of
        writing for portability are so ingrained in the Unix tradition that
        they are applied even to small single-use projects that are thought of as
        throwaway code. They have had secondary effects all through the design
        of the Unix development toolkit, and on programming languages like
        Perl and Python and Tcl that were developed under Unix.</p>
    <p>The direct benefit of portability is that it is normal for Unix
        software to outlive its original hardware platform, so tools and
        applications don&apos;t have to be reinvented every few years. Today,
        applications originally written for Version 7 Unix (1979) are
        routinely used not merely on Unixes genetically descended from V7, but
        on variants like Linux</p>
    <p>The indirect benefits are less obvious but may be more important.
        The discipline of portability tends to exert a simplifying influence on
        architectures, interfaces, and implementations. This both increases
        the odds of project success and reduces life-cycle maintenance
        costs.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, we&apos;ll survey the scope and history of Unix
        standards. We&apos;ll discuss which ones are still relevant today and
        describe the areas of greater and lesser variance in the Unix API.
        We&apos;ll examine the tools and practices that Unix developers use to keep
        code portable, and develop some guides to good practice.</p>

                unexpected persistence. Unix originated as a research toy hacked
                together by some researchers between projects, half to play with
                file-system ideas and half to host a game. The second was summed up by
