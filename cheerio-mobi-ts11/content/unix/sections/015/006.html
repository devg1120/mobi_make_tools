        </div>
    </div>
    <p>An issue related to choice of language is choice of X toolkit
        for GUI programming. Recall the discussion in <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;1.&#xFFFD;Philosophy">Chapter&#xFFFD;1</a> of how X separates mechanism from
        policy. Each possible choice of toolkit will give you a slightly
        different look and feel.</p>
    <p>Your choice of X toolkit will be connected to your choice of
        application language in two ways: first, because some languages ship
        with a binding to a preferred toolkit, and second because some
        toolkits only have bindings to a limited set of languages.</p>
    <p>Java</p>
    <p>The once-ubiquitous Motif toolkit is effectively dead. It
        couldn&apos;t keep up with the newer toolkits distributed without license fees
        or restrictions. These attracted more developer effort until they
        surged past closed-source toolkits in capability and features;
        nowadays, the competition is all in open source.</p>
    <p>The four toolkits to consider seriously in 2003 are Tk,
        GTK, Qt, and wxWindows, with GTK and Qt being the clear front runners.
        All four have ports on MacOS and Windows, so any choice will give you
        the capability to do cross-platform development.</p>
    <p>The Tk toolkit is the oldest of the four and has the advantage
        of incumbency; it&apos;s native in Tcl and bindings to it are shipped with
        the stock version of Python</p>
    <p>GTK began life as a replacement for Motif, and was invented to
        support the GIMP</p>
    <p>Qt is a toolkit associated with the KDE project. It is natively
        a C++</p>
    <p>wxWindows is also natively C++</p>
    <p>As of mid-2003 few detailed comparisons have been written, but
        a Web search for &#x201C;X toolkit comparison&#x201D; may turn up some
        useful hits. <a href="ch14s06.html#x_toolkits" title="Table&#xFFFD;14.2.&#xFFFD;Summary of X Toolkits.">Table&#xFFFD;14.2</a> summarizes the

    <p>Architecturally, these libraries are all written at about the
        same abstraction level. GTK and Qt use a slot-and-signal apparatus
        for event-handling so similar that ports between them have been
        reported to be almost trivial. Your choice among them will probably
        be conditioned more by the availability of bindings to your chosen
        development language than anything else.</p>
