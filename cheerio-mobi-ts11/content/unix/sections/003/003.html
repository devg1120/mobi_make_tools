    <p>By the time of the Mozilla release in 1998, the hacker community
        could best be analyzed as a loose collection of factions or tribes
        that included Richard Stallman&apos;s</p>
    <p>A tribe might be grouped around a particular codebase that they
        maintain, or around one or more charismatic influence leaders, or
        around a language or development tool, or around a particular software
        license, or around a technical standard, or around a caretaker
        organization for some part of the infrastructure. Prestige tends to
        correlate with longevity and historical contribution as well as more
        obvious drivers like current market-share and mind-share; thus, perhaps the
        most universally respected of the tribes is the
        IETF</p>
    <p>After 1995 Linux</p>
    <p>Because the post-1980 hacker
        culture</p>
    <p>The Mozilla release helped further concentrate opinions. In
        March of 1998 an unprecedented summit meeting of community influence
        leaders representing almost all of the major tribes convened to
        consider common goals and tactics. That meeting adopted a new label
        for the common development method of all the factions: open
        source.</p>
    <p>Within six months almost all the tribes in the hacker community
        would accept &#x201C;open source&#x201D; as its new banner. Older
        groups like IETF</p>
    <p>The galvanizing effect of the Netscape announcement, and of the
        new prominence of Linux, reached well beyond the Unix community and
        the hacker culture. Beginning in 1995, developers from various
        platforms in the path of Microsoft&apos;s Windows juggernaut (MacOS; Amiga;
        OS/2; DOS; CP/M; the weaker proprietary Unixes; various mainframe,
        minicomputer, and obsolete microcomputer operating systems) had banded
        together around Sun Microsystems&apos;s Java
        language</p>
    <p>Open-source activists welcomed the surge of immigrants from
        everywhere. The old Unix hands began to share the new immigrants&apos;
        dreams of not merely passively out-enduring the Microsoft monopoly,
        but actually reclaiming key markets from it. The open-source
        community as a whole prepared a major push for mainstream
        respectability, and began to welcome alliances with major corporations
        that increasingly feared losing control of their own businesses as
        Microsoft&apos;s lock-in tactics grew ever bolder.</p>
    <p>There was one exception: Richard
        Stallman</p>
    <p>The other (and more important) intention behind &#x201C;open
        source&#x201D; was to present the hacker community&apos;s methods to the
        rest of the world (especially the business mainstream) in a more
        market-friendly, less confrontational way. In this role, fortunately,
        it proved an unqualified success &#x2014; and led to a revival of
        interest in the Unix tradition from which it sprang.</p>
