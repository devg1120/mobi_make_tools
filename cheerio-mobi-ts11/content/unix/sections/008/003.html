            <p>The System V IPC facilities are message-passing facilities based
                on the System V shared memory facility we described earlier.</p>
            <p>Programs that cooperate using System V IPC usually define
                shared protocols based on exchanging short (up to 8K) binary messages.

                and friends. As this style has been largely superseded by text
                protocols passed between sockets, we do not give an example
                here.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Streams networking was invented for Unix Version 8 (1985) by
                Dennis Ritchie</p>
            <p>An interesting feature of both streams and
                STREAMS<sup>[<a id="id2923595" href="ch07s03.html#ftn.id2923595">76</a>]</sup> is that it is possible to push
                protocol-translation modules into the kernel&apos;s processing path, so
                that the device the user process &#x2018;sees&#x2019; through the
                full-duplex channel is actually filtered. This capability could be
                used, for example, to implement a line-editing protocol for a terminal
                device. Or one could implement protocols such as IP or TCP without
                wiring them directly into the kernel.</p>
            <p>Streams originated as an attempt to clean up a messy feature of the
                kernel called &#x2018;line disciplines&#x2019; &#x2014; alternative modes
                of processing character streams coming from serial terminals and early
                local-area networks. But as serial terminals faded from view,
                Ethernet LANs became ubiquitous, and TCP/IP drove out other protocol
                stacks and migrated into Unix kernels, the extra flexibility provided
                by STREAMS had less and less utility. In 2003, System V

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Despite occasional exceptions such as NFS (Network File System)
            and the GNOME project, attempts to import CORBA, ASN.1, and other
            forms of remote-procedure-call interface have largely failed &#x2014;
            these technologies have not been naturalized into the Unix
            culture.</p>
        <p>There seem to be several underlying reasons for this. One is
            that RPC interfaces are not readily
            discoverable</p>
        <p>As a related issue, interfaces that have richer type signatures
            also tend to be more complex, therefore more brittle. Over time, they
            tend to succumb to ontology creep as the inventory of types that get
            passed across interfaces grows steadily larger and the individual types
            more elaborate. Ontology creep is a problem because structs are more
            likely to mismatch than strings; if the ontologies of the programs on
            each side don&apos;t exactly match, it can be very hard to teach them to
            communicate at all, and fiendishly difficult to resolve bugs. The
            most successful RPC applications, such as the Network File System,
            are those in which the application domain naturally has only a
            few simple data types.</p>
        <p>The usual argument for RPC is that it permits
            &#x201C;richer&#x201D; interfaces than methods like text streams
            &#x2014; that is, interfaces with a more elaborate and
            application-specific ontology of data types. But the Rule of
            Simplicity applies! We observed in <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;4.&#xFFFD;Modularity">Chapter&#xFFFD;4</a> that one of the functions of interfaces
            is as choke points that prevent the implementation details of modules
            from leaking into each other. Therefore, the main argument in favor
            of RPC is also an argument that it increases global complexity rather
            than minimizing it.</p>
        <p>With classical RPC, it&apos;s too easy to do things in a complicated
            and obscure way instead of keeping them simple. RPC seems to
            encourage the production of large, baroque, over-engineered systems with
            obfuscated interfaces, high global complexity, and serious
            version-skew and reliability problems &#x2014; a perfect example of
            thick glue layers run amok.</p>
        <p>Windows COM and DCOM are perhaps the archetypal examples of how
            bad this can get, but there are plenty of others. Apple abandoned
            OpenDoc, and both CORBA and the once wildly hyped Java
            RMI</p>
        <p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Robbert van Renesse have given us a
            detailed analysis of the general problem in <i>A Critique of
                the Remote Procedure Call Paradigm</i> [<a href="apb.html#Tanenbaum-VanRenesse" title="[Tanenbaum-VanRenesse]">Tanenbaum-VanRenesse</a>], a paper which should serve as a
            strong cautionary note to anyone considering an architecture based on
            RPC.</p>
        <p>All these problems may predict long-term difficulties for the
            relatively few Unix projects that use RPC. Of these projects, perhaps
            the best known is the GNOME desktop effort.<sup>[<a id="id2923816" href="ch07s03.html#ftn.id2923816">77</a>]</sup> These problems also contribute to the
            notorious security vulnerabilities of exposing NFS servers. </p>
        <p>Unix tradition, on the other hand, strongly favors
            transparent</p>
        <p>Even if text streams were less efficient than RPC, the
            performance loss would be marginal and linear, the kind better
            addressed by upgrading your hardware than by expending development
            time or adding architectural complexity. Anything you might lose in
            performance by using text streams, you gain back in the ability to
            design systems that are simpler &#x2014; easier to monitor, to model,
            and to understand.</p>
        <p>Today, RPC and the Unix attachment to text streams are
            converging in an interesting way, through protocols like XML-RPC and
            SOAP. These, being textual and transparent, are more palatable to Unix
            programmers than the ugly and heavyweight binary serialization formats
            they replace. While they don&apos;t solve all the more general
            problems pointed out by Tanenbaum and van Renesse, they do in some
            ways combine the advantages of both text-stream and RPC worlds.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Though Unix developers have long been comfortable with
            computation by multiple cooperating processes, they do not have a
            native tradition of using threads (processes that share their entire
            address spaces). These are a recent import from elsewhere, and the
            fact that Unix programmers generally dislike them is not merely
            accident or historical contingency.</p>
        <p>From a complexity-control point of view, threads are a bad
            substitute for lightweight processes with their own address spaces;
            the idea of threads is native to operating systems with expensive
            process-spawning and weak IPC facilities. </p>
        <p>By definition, though daughter threads of a process typically
            have separate local-variable stacks, they share the same global
            memory. The task of managing contentions and critical regions in this
            shared address space is quite difficult and a fertile source of global
            complexity and bugs. It can be done, but as the complexity of one&apos;s
            locking regime rises, the chance of races and deadlocks due to
            unanticipated interactions rises correspondingly.</p>
        <p>Threads are a fertile source of bugs because they can too easily
            know too much about each others&apos; internal states. There is no
            automatic encapsulation, as there would be between processes with
            separate address spaces that must do explicit IPC to communicate.
            Thus, threaded programs suffer from not just ordinary contention
            problems, but from entire new categories of timing-dependent bugs that
            are excruciatingly difficult to even reproduce, let alone fix.</p>
        <p>Thread developers have been waking up to this problem. Recent
            thread implementations and standards show an increasing concern with
            providing thread-local storage, which is intended to limit problems
            arising from the shared global address space. As threading APIs move
            in this direction, thread programming starts to look more and more
            like a controlled use of shared memory.</p>

        <p>To add insult to injury, threading has performance costs that
            erode its advantages over conventional process partitioning. While
            threading can get rid of some of the overhead of rapidly switching
            process contexts, locking shared data structures so threads won&apos;t step
            on each other can be just as expensive.</p>

        <p>This problem is fundamental, and has also been a continuing issue
            in the design of Unix kernels for symmetric multiprocessing.
            As your resource-locking gets finer-grained, latency due to locking
            overhead can increase fast enough to swamp the gains from locking
            less core memory.</p>
        <p>One final difficulty with threads is that threading standards
            still tend to be weak and underspecified as of
            mid-2003. Theoretically conforming libraries for Unix standards
            such as POSIX</p>
