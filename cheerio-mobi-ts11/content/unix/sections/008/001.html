    <p>First, though, we need to dispose of a few red herrings. Our
        discussion is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> going to be about using
        concurrency to improve performance. Putting that concern before
        developing a clean architecture that minimizes global complexity is
        premature optimization</p>
    <p>A closely related red herring is threads (that is, multiple
        concurrent processes sharing the same memory-address space). Threading is a
        performance hack. To avoid a long diversion here, we&apos;ll
        examine threads in more detail at the end of this chapter; the
        summary is that they do not reduce global complexity but rather
        <span class="emphasis"><em>increase</em></span> it, and should therefore be avoided
        save under dire necessity.</p>
    <p>Respecting the Rule of Modularity, on the other hand, is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a red herring; doing so can make your
        programs &#x2014; and your life &#x2014; simpler. All the reasons for
        process partitioning are continuous with the reasons for module
        partitioning that we developed in <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;4.&#xFFFD;Modularity">Chapter&#xFFFD;4</a>.</p>
    <p>Another important reason for breaking up programs into
        cooperating processes is for better security. Under Unix, programs
        that must be run by ordinary users, but must have write access to
        security-critical system resources, get that access through a feature
        called the <i>setuid bit</i>.<sup>[<a id="id2915417" href="ch07s01.html#ftn.id2915417">66</a>]</sup> Executable files are the smallest unit
        of code that can hold a setuid bit; thus, every line of code in a
        setuid executable must be trusted. (Well-written setuid programs,
        however, take all necessary privileged actions first and then drop
        their privileges back to user level for the remainder of their
        existence.)</p>
    <p>Usually a setuid program only needs its privileges for one or a
        small handful of operations. It is often possible to break up such a
        program into cooperating processes, a smaller one that needs setuid
        and a larger one that does not. When we can do this, only the code in
        the smaller program has to be trusted. It is in significant part
        because this kind of partitioning and delegation is possible that Unix
        has a better security track record<sup>[<a id="id2915447" href="ch07s01.html#ftn.id2915447">67</a>]</sup> than its competitors.</p>

            <p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2915417" href="ch07s01.html#id2915417">66</a>] </sup>A setuid
                program runs not with the privileges of the user calling it, but with
                the privileges of the owner of the executable. This feature can be
                used to give restricted, program-controlled access to things like the
                password file that nonadministrators should not be allowed to modify
                directly.</p>
