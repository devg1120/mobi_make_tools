                                <p>Now that we have all these methods, what should we do with them?</p>
                                <p>The first thing to notice is that
                                    tempfiles, the more
                                    interactive sort of master/slave process relationship, sockets, RPC,
                                    and all other methods of bidirectional IPC are at some level
                                    equivalent &#x2014; they&apos;re all just ways for programs to exchange data
                                    during their lifetimes. Much of what we do in a sophisticated way
                                    using sockets or shared memory we could do in a primitive way using
                                    tempfiles as mailboxes and signals for notification. The differences
                                    are at the edges, in how programs establish communication, where and
                                    when one does the marshalling and unmarshalling of messages, in what
                                    sorts of buffering problems you may have, and atomicity guarantees you
                                    get on the messages (that is, to what extent you can know that the
                                    result of a single send action from one side will show up as a single
                                    receive event on the other).</p>
                                <p>We&apos;ve seen from the PostgreSQL study that one effective way to
                                    hold down complexity is to break an application into a client/server
                                    pair. The PostgreSQL client and server communicate through an application
                                    protocol over sockets, but very little about the design pattern would
                                    change if they used any other bidirectional IPC method.</p>
                                <p>This kind of partitioning is particularly effective in
                                    situations where multiple instances of the application must manage
                                    access to resources that are shared among all. A single server process
                                    may manage all resource contention, or cooperating peers may each take
                                    responsibility for some critical resource.</p>
                                <p>Client-server partitioning can also help distribute cycle-hungry
                                    applications across multiple hosts. Or it may make them suitable for
                                    distributed computing across the Internet (as with Freeciv). We&apos;ll
                                    discuss the related <i>CLI server</i> pattern in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;11.&#xFFFD;Interfaces">Chapter&#xFFFD;11</a>.</p>
                                <p>Because all these peer-to-peer IPC techniques are alike at some
                                    level, we should evaluate them mainly on the amount of
                                    program-complexity overhead they incur, and how much opacity they
                                    introduce into our designs. This, ultimately, is why BSD sockets have
                                    won over other Unix IPC methods, and why RPC has generally failed to
                                    get much traction.</p>
                                <p>Threads are fundamentally different. Rather than supporting
                                    communication among different programs, they support a sort of
                                    timesharing within an instance of a single program. Rather
                                    than being a way to partition a big program into smaller ones
                                    with simpler behavior, threading is strictly a performance hack. It
                                    has all the problems normally associated with performance hacks, and
                                    a few special ones of its own.</p>
                                <p>Accordingly, while we should seek ways to break up large
                                    programs into simpler cooperating processes, the use of threads within
                                    processes should be a last resort rather than a first. Often, you may
                                    find you can avoid them. If you can use limited shared memory and
                                    semaphores, asynchronous I/O using <tt>SIGIO</tt>, or
                                    poll(2)/select(2)
                                    rather than threading, do it that way. Keep it simple; use techniques
                                    earlier on this list and lower on the complexity scale in preference
                                    to later ones. </p>
                                <p>The combination of threads, remote-procedure-call interfaces, and
                                    heavyweight object-oriented design is especially dangerous. Used
                                    sparingly and tastefully, any of these techniques can be valuable &#x2014;
                                    but if you are ever invited onto a project that is supposed to feature
                                    all three, fleeing in terror might well be an appropriate
                                    reaction.</p>
                                <p>We have previously observed that programming in the real world
                                    is all about managing complexity. Tools to manage complexity are good
                                    things. But when the effect of those tools is to proliferate
                                    complexity rather than to control it, we would be better off throwing them
                                    away and starting from zero. An important part of the Unix wisdom
                                    is to never forget this.</p>
