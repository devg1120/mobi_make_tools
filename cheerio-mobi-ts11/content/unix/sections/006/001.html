    <p>Pipes and sockets will pass binary data as well as text. But
        there are good reasons the examples we&apos;ll see in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a> are textual: reasons that hark back
        to Doug McIlroy&apos;s</p>
    <p>Also, the very limitations of text streams help enforce
        encapsulation. By discouraging elaborate representations with rich,
        densely encoded structure, text streams also discourage programs from
        being promiscuous with each other about their internal states and help
        enforce encapsulation. We&apos;ll return to this point at the end of <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;7.&#xFFFD;Multiprogramming">Chapter&#xFFFD;7</a> when we discuss RPC.</p>
    <p>When you feel the urge to design a complex binary file format,
        or a complex binary application protocol, it is generally wise to
        lie down until the feeling passes. If performance is what you&apos;re
        worried about, implementing compression on the text protocol stream
        either at some level below or above the application protocol will
        give you a cleaner and perhaps better-performing design than a
        binary protocol (text compresses well, and quickly).</p>

    <p>Designing a textual protocol tends to future-proof your system.
        One specific reason is that ranges on numeric fields aren&apos;t implied by
        the format itself. Binary formats usually specify the number of bits
        allocated to a given value, and extending them is difficult. For
        example, IPv4 only allows 32 bits for an address. To extend address
        size to 128 bits (as done by IPv6) requires a major
        revamping.<sup>[<a id="id2901165" href="ch05s01.html#ftn.id2901165">51</a>]</sup> In contrast, if you need a larger value
        in a text format, just write it. It may be that a given program can&apos;t
        receive values in that range, but it&apos;s usually easier to modify the
        program than to modify all the data stored in that format.</p>
    <p>The only good justification for a binary protocol is if you&apos;re
        going to be manipulating large enough data sets that you&apos;re genuinely
        worried about getting the most bit-density out of your media, or if
        you&apos;re very concerned about the time or instruction budget required to
        interpret the data into an in-core structure. Formats for large
        images and multimedia are sometimes an example of the former, and
        network protocols with hard latency requirements sometimes an
        example of the latter.</p>

    <p>These concerns are valid in other extreme cases as well as in X
        &#x2014; for example, in the design of graphics file formats intended
        to hold very large images. But they are usually just another case of
        premature-optimization</p>
    <p>In addition, the kind of thinking that goes into designing tight
        binary formats tends to fall down on making them cleanly extensible.

        <p>On many operating systems, the per-user data required to
            validate logins and start a user&apos;s session is an opaque binary
            database. Under Unix, by contrast, it&apos;s a text file with records one
            per line and colon-separated fields.</p>
        <p><a href="ch05s01.html#passwd" title="Example&#xFFFD;5.1.&#xFFFD;Password file example.">Example&#xFFFD;5.1</a> consists of some randomly-chosen
            example lines:</p>
        <div class="example"><a id="passwd">
                <p class="title"><b>Example&#xFFFD;5.1.&#xFFFD;Password file example.</b></p>

</pre>
            </a></div>
        <p>Without even knowing anything about the semantics of the fields,
            we can notice that it would be hard to pack the data much tighter in
            a binary format. The colon sentinel characters would have to have
            functional equivalents taking at least as much space (usually
            either count bytes or NULs). The per-user records would either have
            to have terminators (which could hardly be shorter than a single
            newline) or else be wastefully padded out to a fixed length.</p>
        <p>Actually the prospects for saving space through binary encoding
            pretty much vanish if you know the actual semantics of the data. The
            numeric user ID (3rd) and group ID (4th) fields are integers, thus on
            most machines a binary representation would be at least 4 bytes, and
            longer than the text for values up to 999. But let&apos;s agree to ignore
            this for now and suppose the best case that the numeric fields have a
            0-255 range.</p>
        <p>We could tighten up the numeric fields (3rd and 4th) by
            collapsing the numerics to single bytes, and the password strings
            (2nd) to an 8-bit encoding. On this example, that would give about an
            8% size decrease.</p>
        <p>That 8% of putative inefficiency buys us a lot. It avoids
            putting an arbitrary limit on the range of the numeric fields. It
            gives us the ability to modify the password file with any old text
            editor of our choice, rather than having to build a specialized tool
            to edit a binary format (though in the case of the password file
            itself, we have to be extra careful about concurrent edits). And it
            gives us the ability to do ad-hoc searches and filters and reports on
            the user account information with text-stream tools such as
            grep(1).</p>
        <p>We do have to be a bit careful about not embedding a colon in
            any of the textual fields. Good practice is to tell the file write
            code to precede embedded colons with an escape character, and then to
            tell the file read code to interpret it. Unix tradition favors
            backslash for this use.</p>
        <p>The fact that structural information is conveyed by field
            position rather than an explicit tag makes this format faster
            to read and write, but a bit rigid. If the set of properties
            associated with a key is expected to change with any frequency,
            one of the tagged formats described below might be a better choice.
        </p>
        <p>Economy is not a major issue with password files to begin with,
            as they&apos;re normally read seldom<sup>[<a id="id2901458" href="ch05s01.html#ftn.id2901458">52</a>]</sup> and infrequently modified. Interoperability
            is not an issue, since various data in the file (notably user and
            group numbers) are not portable off the originating machine. For
            password files, it&apos;s therefore quite clear that going where the
            transparency

        <p>Each line sets properties for the newsgroup named in the first
            field. The name is immediately followed by a character that indicates
            whether the owning user is currently subscribed to the group or not; a colon
            indicates subscription, and an exclamation mark indicates
            nonsubscription. The remainder of the line is a sequence of
            comma-separated article numbers or ranges of article numbers,
            indicating which articles the user has seen.</p>
        <p> Non-Unix programmers might have automatically tried to design a
            fast binary format in which each newsgroup status was described by
            either a long but fixed-length binary record, or a sequence of
            self-describing binary packets with internal length fields. The main
            point of such a binary representation would be to express ranges with
            binary data in paired word-length fields, in order to avoid the
            overhead of parsing all the range expressions at startup.</p>
        <p>Such a layout could be read and written faster than a textual
            format, but it would have other problems. A na&#xFFFD;ve implementation
            in fixed-length records would have placed artificial length limits on
            newsgroup names and (more seriously) on the maximum number of ranges
            of seen-article numbers. A more sophisticated binary-packet format
            would avoid the length limits, but could not be edited with the user&apos;s
            eyeballs and fingers &#x2014; a capability that can be quite useful
            when you want to reset just some of the read bits in an individual
            newsgroup. Also, it would not necessarily be portable to different
            machine types.</p>
