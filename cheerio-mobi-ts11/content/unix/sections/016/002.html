    <p>The first and most basic tool of development is a text editor
        suitable for modifying and writing programs.</p>
    <p>Literally dozens of text editors are available under Unix;
        writing one seems to be one of the standard finger exercises for
        budding open-source
        hackers</p>
    <p>For serious editing work, two editors completely dominate the
        Unix programming scene. Each is available in a couple of minor variant
        implementations, but has a standard version you can rely on finding on
        any modern Unix system. These two editors are
        <i>vi</i> and <i>Emacs</i>.
        We discussed them in <a href="complexitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;13.&#xFFFD;Complexity">Chapter&#xFFFD;13</a> as part of our discussion of the right
        size of software.</p>
    <p>As we noted in <a href="complexitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;13.&#xFFFD;Complexity">Chapter&#xFFFD;13</a>, these two editors express sharply
        contrasting design philosophies, but both are extremely popular and
        command great loyalty from identifiable core user populations. Surveys
        of Unix programmers consistently indicate about a 50/50 split between
        them, with all other editors barely registering.</p>
    <p>In our earlier examinations of <i>vi</i> and
        <i>Emacs</i>, we were primarily concerned with
        their optional complexity and the surrounding design-philosophy issues.
        Many other things are worth knowing about these editors, both as a
        matter of practicality and of Unix cultural literacy.</p>

        </div>
        <p><i>Emacs</i> stands for &#x2018;EDiting
            MACroS&#x2019; (pronounce it <span class="phonetic">/ee&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;maks/</span>). It was originally
            written in the late 1970s as a set of macros in an editor called TECO,
            then reimplemented several times in different ways. In an amusing
            twist, modern Emacs implementations include a TECO emulation
            mode.</p>
        <p>In our earlier discussion of editors and optional complexity, we
            noted that many people consider Emacs
            excessively heavyweight. However, investing the time to learn it can
            yield rich rewards in productivity. Emacs
            supports many powerful editing modes that offer help with the syntax
            of various programming languages and markups. We&apos;ll see later in this
            chapter how Emacs can be used in
            combination with other development tools to give capabilities
            comparable to (and in many ways surpassing) those of conventional
            IDEs.</p>
        <p>The standard Emacs, universally
            available on modern Unixes, is <i>GNU Emacs</i>;
            this is what generally runs if you type <b>emacs</b> to a
            Unix shell prompt. GNU Emacs sources and documentation are available
            at the <a href="ftp://gnu.org/pub/gnu" target="_top">Free Software Foundation
                archive site</a></p>
        <p>The only major variant is called
            <i>XEmacs</i>; it has a better X interface but
            otherwise quite similar capabilities (it forked from Emacs
            19). <i>XEmacs</i> has a <a href="http://www.xemacs.org" target="_top">home page</a>.
            Emacs (and Emacs Lisp) is universally
            available under modern Unixes. It has been ported to MS-DOS (where it
            works poorly) and Windows 95 and NT (where it is said to work
            reasonably well).</p>
        <p>Emacs includes its own interactive
            tutorial and very complete on-line documentation; you&apos;ll find
            instructions on how to invoke both on the default
            Emacs startup screen. A good introduction
            on paper is <i>Learning GNU Emacs</i> [<a href="apb.html#Cameron" title="[Cameron]">Cameron</a>].</p>
        <p>The keystroke commands used in the Unix ports of
            Netscape/Mozilla and Internet Explorer text windows (in forms and the
            mailer) are copied from the stock Emacs
            bindings for basic text editing. These bindings are the closest thing
            to a cross-platform standard for editor keystrokes.</p>

        <p>Many people who regularly use both <i>vi</i> and
            Emacs tend to use them for different
            things, and find it valuable to know both.</p>
        <p>In general, <i>vi</i> is best for small jobs
            &#x2014; quick replies to mail, simple tweaks to system configuration,
            and the like. It is especially useful when you&apos;re using a new system
            (or a remote one over a network) and don&apos;t have your
            Emacs customization files handy.</p>
        <p>Emacs comes into its own for extended
            editing sessions in which you have to handle complex tasks, modify
            multiple files, and use results from other programs during the
            session. For programmers using X on their console (which is typical on
            modern Unixes), it&apos;s normal to start up
            Emacs shortly after login time in a large
            window and leave it running forever, possibly visiting dozens of files
            and even running programs in multiple Emacs
            subwindows.</p>
