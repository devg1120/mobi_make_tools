    <p>Master Foo once said to a visiting programmer: “There is
        more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
        lines of C”.</p>
    <p>The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said:
        “How can this be? C is the language in which the very kernel of
        Unix is implemented!”</p>
    <p>Master Foo replied: “That is so. Nevertheless, there is
        more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
        lines of C”.</p>
    <p>The programmer grew distressed. “But through the C
        language we experience the enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie! We
        become as one with the operating system and the machine, reaping
        matchless performance!”</p>
    <p>Master Foo replied: “All that you say is true. But there
        is still more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten
        thousand lines of C”.</p>
    <p>The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But
        Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell
        script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: “Master programmer,
        consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten
        thousand lines?”</p>
    <p>The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what
        Nubi had written. Finally he agreed that it was so.</p>
    <p>“And how many hours would you require to implement and
        debug that C program?” asked Nubi.</p>
    <p>“Many”, admitted the visiting programmer.
        “But only a fool would spend the time to do that when so many
        more worthy tasks await him”.</p>
    <p>“And who better understands the Unix-nature?”
        Master Foo asked. “Is it he who writes the ten thousand
        lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by
        not coding?”</p>
    <p>Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.</p>
