    <p>A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was
        eating the morning meal with his students.</p>
    <p>“I hear y00 are very l33t”, he said.
        “Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know”.</p>
    <p>Master Foo's students looked at each other, confused by the
        stranger's barbarous language. Master Foo just smiled and replied:
        “You wish to learn the Way of Unix?”</p>
    <p>“I want to b3 a wizard hax0r”, the stranger
        replied, “and 0wn ever3one's b0xen”.</p>
    <p>“I do not teach that Way”, replied Master Foo.</p>
    <p>The stranger grew agitated. “D00d, y00 r nothing but a
        p0ser”, he said. “If y00 n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch
        m3”.</p>
    <p>“There is a path”, said Master Foo, “that
        might bring you to wisdom”. The master scribbled an IP address on
        a piece of paper. “Cracking this box should pose you little
        difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent. Return and tell me
        what you find”.</p>
    <p>The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.</p>
    <p>Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.</p>
    <p>Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.</p>
    <p>“Damn you!” he said, “I cracked that box, and
        it was easy like you said. But I got busted by the FBI and thrown
        in jail”.</p>
    <p>“Good”, said Master Foo. “You are ready for
        the next lesson”. He scribbled an IP address on another piece
        of paper and handed it to the stranger.</p>
    <p>“Are you <span class="emphasis"><em>crazy</em></span>?” the stranger
        yelled. “After what I've been through, I'm never going to break
        into a computer again!”</p>
    <p>Master Foo smiled. “Here”, he said, “is the
        beginning of wisdom”.</p>
    <p>On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.</p>
