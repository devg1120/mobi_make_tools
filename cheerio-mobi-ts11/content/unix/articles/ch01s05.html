    <p>The explosive recent growth of Linux<a id="id2808830" class="indexterm">, and the increasing importance
            of the Internet, give us good reasons to suppose that the skeptics'
            case is wrong. But even supposing the skeptical assessment is true,
            Unix culture is worth learning because there are some things that Unix
            and its surrounding culture clearly do better than any
            competitors.</a></p>

        <p>Though the term “open
            source”<a id="id2808857" class="indexterm">
                and the Open Source Definition were not invented until 1998,
                peer-review-intensive development of freely shared source code was a key
                feature of the Unix culture from its beginnings.</a></p>
        <p>For its first ten years
            AT&T's<a id="id2872763" class="indexterm"> original
                Unix, and its primary variant Berkeley Unix, were normally distributed
                with source code. This enabled most of the other good things that
                follow here.</a></p>

        <p>Unix is still the only operating system that can present a
            consistent, documented application programming interface (API) across
            a heterogeneous mix of computers, vendors, and special-purpose
            hardware. It is the only operating system that can scale from embedded
            chips and handhelds, up through desktop machines, through servers, and
            all the way to special-purpose number-crunching behemoths and database
            back ends.</p>
        <p>The Unix API is the closest thing to a hardware-independent
            standard for writing truly portable software that exists. It is no
            accident that what the IEEE originally called the <i>Portable
                Operating System Standard</i> quickly got a suffix added to
            its acronym and became
            POSIX<a id="id2872806" class="indexterm">. A
                Unix-equivalent API was the only credible model for such a
                standard.</a></p>
        <p>Binary-only applications for other operating systems die with
            their birth environments, but Unix sources are forever. Forever, at
            least, given a Unix technical culture that polishes and maintains
            them across decades.</p>

                much to Unix as it does to the ancestral ARPANET. In particular, the
                concept of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) so central to the Web is
                a generalization of the Unix idea of one uniform file namespace
                everywhere. To function effectively as an Internet expert, an

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The community that originally formed around the early Unix
            source distributions never went away — after the great Internet
            explosion of the early 1990s, it recruited an entire new generation of
            eager hackers<a id="id2872957" class="indexterm"> on home
                machines.</a></p>
        <p>Today, that community is a powerful support group for all kinds
            of software development. High-quality open-source development tools
            abound in the Unix world (we'll examine many in this
            book). Open-source Unix applications are usually equal to, and are
            often superior to, their proprietary equivalents [<a href="apb.html#Fuzz" title="[Fuzz]">Fuzz</a>]. Entire Unix operating systems, with complete
            toolkits and basic applications suites, are available for free over
            the Internet. Why code from scratch when you can adapt, reuse,
            recycle, and save yourself 90% of the work?</p>
        <p>This tradition of code-sharing depends heavily on hard-won
            expertise about how to make programs cooperative and reusable. And
            not by abstract theory, but through a lot of engineering practice
            — unobvious design rules that allow programs to function not just
            as isolated one-shot solutions but as synergistic parts of a
            toolkit. A major purpose of this book is to elucidate those rules.</p>
        <p>Today, a burgeoning open-source movement is bringing new
            vitality, new technical approaches, and an entire generation of bright
            young programmers into the Unix tradition. Open-source projects
            including the Linux<a id="id2873005" class="indexterm"> operating system and symbionts such as
                Apache<a id="id2873014" class="indexterm"> and Mozilla
                    have brought the Unix tradition an unprecedented level of mainstream
                    visibility and success. The open-source movement seems on the verge of
                    winning its bid to define the computing infrastructure of tomorrow
                    — and the core of that infrastructure will be Unix machines
                    running on the Internet.</a></a></p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Many operating systems touted as more ‘modern’ or
            ‘user friendly’ than Unix achieve their surface glossiness by
            locking users and developers into one interface policy, and offer
            an application-programming interface that for all its elaborateness
            is rather narrow and rigid. On such systems, tasks the designers
            have anticipated are very easy — but tasks they have not
            anticipated are often impossible or at best extremely�painful.</p>
        <p>Unix, on the other hand, has flexibility in depth. The many ways
            Unix provides to glue together programs mean that components of its
            basic toolkit can be combined to produce useful effects that the
            designers of the individual toolkit parts never anticipated.</p>
        <p>Unix's support of multiple styles of program interface (often
            seen as a weakness because it increases the perceived complexity of
            the system to end users) also contributes to flexibility; no
            program that wants to be a simple piece of data plumbing is forced
            to carry the complexity overhead of an elaborate GUI.</p>
        <p>Unix tradition lays heavy emphasis on keeping programming
            interfaces relatively small, clean, and orthogonal — another trait
            that produces flexibility in depth. Throughout a Unix system, easy
            things are easy and hard things are at least possible.</p>

                <h3 class="title"><a id="id2873078">Unix Is Fun to Hack</a></h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>People who pontificate about Unix's technical superiority often
            don't mention what may ultimately be its most important strength,
            the one that underlies all its successes. Unix is fun to hack.</p>
        <p>Unix boosters seem almost ashamed to acknowledge this sometimes,
            as though admitting they're having fun might damage their
            legitimacy somehow. But it's true; Unix is fun to play with and
            develop for, and always has been.</p>
        <p>There are not many operating systems that anyone has ever
            described as ‘fun’. Indeed, the friction and labor of
            development under most other environments has been aptly compared to
            kicking a dead whale down the beach.<sup>[<a id="id2873107" href="ch01s05.html#ftn.id2873107">8</a>]</sup> The kindest
            adjectives one normally hears are on the order of
            “tolerable” or “not too painful”. In the Unix
            world, by contrast, the operating system rewards effort rather than
            frustrating it. People programming under Unix usually come to see
            it not as an adversary to be clubbed into doing one's bidding by main
            effort but rather as an actual positive help.</p>
        <p>This has real economic significance. The fun factor started a
            virtuous circle early in Unix's history. People liked Unix, so they
            built more programs for it that made it nicer to use. Today people
            build entire, production-quality open-source Unix systems as a
            hobby. To understand how remarkable this is, ask yourself when you
            last heard of anybody cloning OS/360 or VAX VMS<a id="id2873140" class="indexterm"> or Microsoft
                Windows<a id="id2873148" class="indexterm"> for fun.</a></a></p>
        <p>The ‘fun’ factor is not trivial from a design point
            of view, either. The kind of people who become programmers and
            developers have ‘fun’ when the effort they have to put out
            to do a task challenges them, but is just within their
            capabilities. ‘Fun’ is therefore a sign of peak
            efficiency. Painful development environments waste labor and
            creativity; they extract huge hidden costs in time, money, and
            opportunity.</p>
        <p>If Unix were a failure in every other way, the Unix engineering
            culture would be worth studying for the ways it keeps the fun
            in development — because that fun is a sign that it makes
            developers efficient, effective, and productive.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Unix programmers have accumulated decades of experience
            while pioneering operating-system features we now take for granted.
            Even non-Unix programmers can benefit from studying that Unix
            experience. Because Unix makes it relatively easy to apply good design
            principles and development methods, it is an excellent place to
            learn them.</p>
        <p>Other operating systems generally make good practice rather
            more difficult, but even so some of the Unix culture's lessons can
            transfer. Much Unix code (including all its filters, its major
            scripting languages<a id="id2873204" class="indexterm">, and many of its code generators) will
                port directly to any operating system supporting ANSI
                C<a id="id2873214" class="indexterm"> (for the
                    excellent reason that C<a id="id2873223" class="indexterm"> itself was a Unix invention and the
                        ANSI C library embodies a substantial chunk of Unix's
