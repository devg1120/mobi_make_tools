    <p>A Unix zealot, having heard that Master Foo was wise in the
        Great Way, came to him for instruction. Master Foo said to him:</p>
    <p>“When the Patriarch Thompson invented Unix, he did not
        understand it. Then he gained in understanding, and no longer invented
        it”.</p>
    <p>“When the Patriarch McIlroy invented the pipe, he knew
        that it would transform software, but did not know that it would
        transform mind”.</p>
    <p>“When the Patriarch Ritchie invented C, he condemned
        programmers to a thousand hells of buffer overruns, heap corruption,
        and stale-pointer bugs”.</p>
    <p>“Truly, the Patriarchs were blind and foolish!”</p>
    <p>The zealot was greatly angered by the Master's words.</p>
    <p>“These enlightened ones”, he protested. “gave
        us the Great Way of Unix. Surely, if we mock them we will lose merit
        and be reborn as beasts or MCSEs”.</p>
    <p>“Is your code ever completely without stain and
        flaw?” demanded Master Foo.</p>
    <p>“No”, admitted the zealot, “no man's
        is”.</p>
    <p>“The wisdom of the Patriarchs”, said Master Foo,
        “was that they <span class="emphasis"><em>knew</em></span> they were
        fools”.</p>
    <p>Upon hearing this, the zealot was enlightened.</p>
