    <p>A Subversion repository can be accessed simultaneously by
        clients running on the same machine on which the repository
        resides using URLs carrying the <code class="literal">file://</code> scheme.
        But the typical Subversion setup involves a single server machine
        being accessed from clients on computers all over the
        office—or, perhaps, all over the world.</p>
    <p>This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository
        exposed outside its host machine for use by remote clients. We
        will cover Subversion's currently available server mechanisms,
        discussing the configuration and use of each. After reading this
        chapter, you should be able to decide which networking setup is
        right for your needs, as well as understand how to enable such a
        setup on your host computer.</p>
