    <p>Version control can be a complex subject, as much art as
        science, that offers myriad ways of getting stuff done.
        Throughout this book, you've read of the various Subversion
        command-line client subcommands and the options that modify their
        behavior. In this chapter, we'll look into still more ways to
        customize the way Subversion works for you—setting up the
        Subversion runtime configuration, using external helper
        applications, Subversion's interaction with the operating system's
        configured locale, and so on.</p>
