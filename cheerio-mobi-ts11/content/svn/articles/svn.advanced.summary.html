    <p>After reading this chapter, you should have a firm grasp on
        some of Subversion's features that, while perhaps not used
        <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> time you interact with your version
        control system, are certainly handy to know about. But don't
        stop here! Read on to the following chapter, where you'll learn
        about branches, tags, and merging. Then you'll have nearly full
        mastery of the Subversion client. Though our lawyers won't
        allow us to promise you anything, this additional knowledge
        could make you measurably more cool.<a href="#ftn.idm3526" class="footnote" id="idm3526"><sup class="footnote">[24]</sup></a></p>
