    <p>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
        repository by performing a <em class="firstterm">checkout</em> of
        your project. Checking out a directory from a repository
        creates a working copy of that directory on your local machine.
        Unless otherwise specified, this copy contains the youngest
        (that is, most recently created or modified) versions of the
        directory and its children found in the Subversion
        repository:</p>
    <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk
A    trunk/README
A    trunk/INSTALL
A    trunk/src/main.c
A    trunk/src/header.h
&#x2026;
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk
        directory, you can just as easily check out a deeper
        subdirectory of a repository by specifying that subdirectory&apos;s
        URL as the checkout URL:</p>
    <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk/src
A    src/main.c
A    src/header.h
A    src/lib/helpers.c
&#x2026;
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge model instead of
        lock-modify-unlock (see ),
        you can immediately make changes to the files and directories in
        your working copy. Your working copy is just like any other
        collection of files and directories on your system. You can
        edit the files inside it, rename it, even delete the entire
        working copy and forget about it.</p>
    <div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <table border="0" summary="Warning">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">
                    <img alt="[Warning]" src="/home/admin/es2015/cheerio-mobi-ts10/content/svn/processed_images/warning-grayscale.gif">
                </td>
                <th align="left">Warning</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="left" valign="top">
                    <p>While your working copy is <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">just like any other
                                collection of files and directories on your system,</span>&#x201D;</span>
                        you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
                        about <span class="emphasis"><em>everything else</em></span> that you do. For
                        example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
                        copy, you should use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> or
                        <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> instead of the copy and move
                        commands provided by your operating system. We&apos;ll talk more
                        about them later in this chapter.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>Unless you&apos;re ready to commit the addition of a new file or
        directory or changes to existing ones, there&apos;s no need to
        further notify the Subversion server that you&apos;ve done
        anything.</p>
    <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p class="title">
                        <strong>What Is This .svn Directory?</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The topmost directory of a working copy&#x2014;and prior to
            version 1.7, every versioned subdirectory
            thereof&#x2014;contains a special administrative subdirectory
            named <code class="filename">.svn</code>. Usually, your operating
            system&apos;s directory listing commands won&apos;t show this
            subdirectory, but it is nevertheless an important directory.
            Whatever you do, don&apos;t delete or change anything in the
            administrative area! Subversion uses that directory and its
            contents to manage your working copy.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Notice that in the previous pair of examples, Subversion
        chose to create a working copy in a directory named for the
        final component of the checkout URL. This occurs only as a
        convenience to the user when the checkout URL is the only bit of
        information provided to the <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>
        command. Subversion&apos;s command-line client gives you additional
        flexibility, though, allowing you to optionally specify the
        local directory name that Subversion should use for the working
        copy it creates. For example:</p>
    <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk my-working-copy
A    my-working-copy/README
A    my-working-copy/INSTALL
A    my-working-copy/src/main.c
A    my-working-copy/src/header.h
&#x2026;
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>If the local directory you specify doesn&apos;t yet
        exist, that&apos;s okay&#x2014;<span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> will
        create it for you.</p>
