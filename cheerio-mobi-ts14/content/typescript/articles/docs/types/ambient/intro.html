<h2 id="ambient-declarations">Ambient Declarations</h2>
<p>As we mentioned in <a href="../../why-typescript.html">why TypeScript</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A major design goal of TypeScript was to make it possible for you to safely and easily use existing JavaScript libraries in TypeScript. TypeScript does this by means of <em>declaration</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ambient declarations allow you to <em>safely use existing popular JavaScript libraries</em> and <em>incrementally migrate your JavaScript/CoffeeScript/Other-Compile-To-Js-Language project to TypeScript</em>.</p>
<p>Studying patterns in ambient declarations for <em>third party JavaScript code</em> is good practice for annotating <em>your</em> TypeScript code base as well. This is why we present it so early on.</p>
