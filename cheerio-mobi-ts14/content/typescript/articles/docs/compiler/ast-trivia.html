<h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3>
<p>Trivia (called that because it's <code>trivial</code>) represent the parts of the source text that are largely insignificant for normal understanding of the code. For example; whitespace, comments, and even conflict markers. Trivia is <em>not stored</em> in the AST (to keep it lightweight). However, it can be fetched <em>on demand</em> using a few <code>ts.*</code> APIs. </p>
<p>Before we show them you need to understand the following:</p>
<h4 id="trivia-ownership">Trivia Ownership</h4>
<p>In General:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A token owns any trivia after it on the <em>same</em> line <em>upto</em> the next token.</li>
    <li>Any comment <em>after that line</em> is associated with the following token.</li>
</ul>
<p>For leading and ending comments in a file:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first token in the source file gets all the initial trivia.</li>
    <li>The last sequence of trivia in the file is tacked onto the end-of-file token, which otherwise has zero width.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="trivia-apis">Trivia APIs</h4>
<p>For most basic uses, comments are the "interesting" trivia. The comments that belong to a Node can be fetched through the following functions:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Function</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>ts.getLeadingCommentRanges</code></td>
            <td>Given the source text and position within that text, returns ranges of comments between the first line break following the given position and the token itself (probably most useful with <code>ts.Node.getFullStart</code>).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>ts.getTrailingCommentRanges</code></td>
            <td>Given the source text and position within that text, returns ranges of comments until the first line break following the given position (probably most useful with <code>ts.Node.getEnd</code>).</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>As an example, imagine this portion of a source file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ts">debugger;<span class="hljs-comment">/*hello*/</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">//bye</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">/*hi*/</span>    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>getLeadingCommentRanges</code> for the <code>function</code> will only return the last 2 comments <code>//bye</code> and <code>/*hi*/</code>.</p>
<p>Appropriately, calling <code>getTrailingCommentRanges</code> on the end of the debugger statement will extract the <code>/*hello*/</code> comment.</p>
<h4 id="token-startfull-start">Token Start/Full Start</h4>
<p>Nodes have what is called a "token start" and a "full start".</p>
<ul>
    <li>Token Start: the more natural version, which is the position in file where the text of a token begins</li>
    <li>Full Start: the point at which the scanner began scanning since the last significant token</li>
</ul>
<p>AST nodes have an API for <code>getStart</code> and <code>getFullStart</code>. In the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ts">debugger;<span class="hljs-comment">/*hello*/</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">//bye</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">/*hi*/</span>    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>for <code>function</code> the token start is at <code>function</code> whereas <em>full</em> start is at <code>/*hello*/</code>. Note that full start even includes the trivia that would otherwise be owned by the previous node.</p>
