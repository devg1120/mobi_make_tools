<h1 id="your-javascript-is-typescript">Your JavaScript is TypeScript</h1>
<p>There were (and will continue to be) a lot of competitors in <em>Some syntax</em> to <em>JavaScript</em> compilers. TypeScript is different from them in that <em>Your JavaScript is TypeScript</em>. Here's a diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basarat/typescript-book/master/images/venn.png" alt="JavaScript is TypeScript"></p>
<p>However, it does mean that <em>you need to learn JavaScript</em> (the good news is <em>you <strong>only</strong> need to learn JavaScript</em>). TypeScript is just standardizing all the ways you provide <em>good documentation</em> on JavaScript.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Just giving you a new syntax doesn't help fix bugs (looking at you CoffeeScript).</li>
    <li>Creating a new language abstracts you too far from your runtimes, communities (looking at you Dart).</li>
</ul>
<p>TypeScript is just JavaScript with docs.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>JSNext is open to interpretation - not everything proposed for the next version of JS actually makes it to browsers. TypeScript only adds support for proposals once they reach <a href="https://tc39.es/process-document/" target="_blank">stage 3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="making-javascript-better">Making JavaScript Better</h2>
<p>TypeScript will try to protect you from portions of JavaScript that never worked (so you don't need to remember this stuff):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ts">[] + []; <span class="hljs-comment">// JavaScript will give you "" (which makes little sense), TypeScript will error</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">//</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// other things that are nonsensical in JavaScript</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// - don't give a runtime error (making debugging hard)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// - but TypeScript will give a compile time error (making debugging unnecessary)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//</span>
{} + []; <span class="hljs-comment">// JS : 0, TS Error</span>
[] + {}; <span class="hljs-comment">// JS : "[object Object]", TS Error</span>
{} + {}; <span class="hljs-comment">// JS : NaN or [object Object][object Object] depending upon browser, TS Error</span>
<span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span> - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// JS : NaN, TS Error</span>

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">add</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a,b</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>
    a + b; <span class="hljs-comment">// JS : undefined, TS Error 'unreachable code detected'</span>
}

<p>Essentially TypeScript is linting JavaScript. Just doing a better job at it than other linters that don't have <em>type information</em>.</p>
<h2 id="you-still-need-to-learn-javascript">You still need to learn JavaScript</h2>
<p>That said TypeScript is very pragmatic about the fact that <em>you do write JavaScript</em> so there are some things about JavaScript that you still need to know in order to not be caught off-guard. Let's discuss them next.</p>

    <p>Note: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Just with documentation that can actually be used by compilers / IDEs ;)</p>
