      <p>This chapter is a short, casual introduction to Subversion and
    its approach to version control.  We begin with a discussion of
    general version control concepts, work our way into the specific
    ideas behind Subversion, and show some simple examples of
    Subversion in use.</p>
      <p>Even though the examples in this chapter show people sharing
    collections of program source code, keep in mind that Subversion
    can manage any sort of file collection—it's not limited to
    helping computer programmers.</p>
