      <p>Subversion tracks tree structures, not just file contents.
      It&apos;s one of the biggest reasons Subversion was written to
      replace CVS.</p>
      <p>Here&apos;s what this means to you, as a former CVS user:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          delete</strong></span> commands work on directories now, just as
          they work on files.  So do <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>.  However, these commands do
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> cause any kind of immediate change
          in the repository.  Instead, the working items are simply
          <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">scheduled</span>&#x201D;</span> for addition or deletion.  No
          repository changes happen until you run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
          commit</code></strong>.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Directories aren&apos;t dumb containers anymore; they have
          revision numbers like files.  (Or more properly, it&apos;s
          correct to talk about <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">directory
          <code class="filename">foo/</code> in revision 5.</span>&#x201D;</span>)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Let&apos;s talk more about that last point.  Directory versioning
      is a hard problem; because we want to allow mixed-revision
      working copies, there are some limitations on how far we can
      abuse this model.</p>
      <p>From a theoretical point of view, we define <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">revision
      5 of directory <code class="filename">foo</code></span>&#x201D;</span> to mean a
      specific collection of directory entries and properties.  Now
      suppose we start adding and removing files from
      <code class="filename">foo</code>, and then commit.  It would be a lie
      to say that we still have revision 5 of
      <code class="filename">foo</code>.  However, if we bumped
      <code class="filename">foo</code>&apos;s revision number after the commit,
      that would be a lie too; there may be other changes to
      <code class="filename">foo</code> we haven&apos;t yet received, because we
      haven&apos;t updated yet.</p>
      <p>Subversion deals with this problem by quietly tracking
      committed adds and deletes in the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
      area.  When you eventually run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>,
      all accounts are settled with the repository, and the
      directory&apos;s new revision number is set correctly.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore, only after an update is it truly safe to
      say that you have a <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">perfect</span>&#x201D;</span> revision of a
      directory.</em></span> Most of the time, your working copy will
      contain <span class="quote">&#x201C;<span class="quote">imperfect</span>&#x201D;</span> directory revisions.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a problem arises if you attempt to commit
      property changes on a directory.  Normally, the commit would
      bump the working directory&apos;s local revision number.  But again,
      that would be a lie, as there may be adds or deletes that
      the directory doesn&apos;t yet have, because no update has happened.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore, you are not allowed to commit
      property changes on a directory unless the directory is
      up to date.</em></span></p>
