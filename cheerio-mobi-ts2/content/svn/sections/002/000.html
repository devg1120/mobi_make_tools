      <p>In the world of open source software, the Concurrent Versions
    System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control for many
    years.  And rightly so.  CVS was open source software itself, and
    its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked
    operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers
    to share their work.  It fit the collaborative nature of the
    open source world very well.  CVS and its semi-chaotic development
    model have since become cornerstones of open source
    culture.</p>
      <p>But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those
    flaws promised to be an enormous effort.  Enter Subversion.
    Subversion was designed to be a successor to CVS, and its
    originators set out to win the hearts of CVS users in two
    ways—by creating an open source system with a design
    (and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">look and feel</span>”</span>) similar to CVS, and by
    attempting to avoid most of CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the
    result wasn't—and isn't—the next great evolution in
    version control design, Subversion <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> very
    powerful, very usable, and very flexible.</p>
      <p>This book is written to document the 1.7 series of the Apache
    Subversion™<a href="#ftn.idm79" class="footnote" id="idm79"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> version control system.  We have made
    every attempt to be thorough in our coverage.  However, Subversion
    has a thriving and energetic development community, so already a
    number of features and improvements are planned for future
    versions that may change some of the commands and specific notes
    in this book.</p>
