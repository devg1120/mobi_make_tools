      <p>WebDAV is an extension to HTTP, and it is growing more and more
    popular as a standard for file sharing.  Today's operating systems
    are becoming extremely web-aware, and many now have built-in
    support for mounting <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shares</span>”</span> exported by WebDAV
    servers.</p>
      <p>If you use Apache as your Subversion network server, to
    some extent you are also running a WebDAV server.  This appendix
    gives some background on the nature of this protocol, how
    Subversion uses it, and how well Subversion interoperates with
    other software that is WebDAV-aware.</p>
