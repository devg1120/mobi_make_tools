      </div>
      <p>So, which server should you use?  Which is best?</p>
      <p>Obviously, there's no right answer to that question.  Every
      team has different needs, and the different servers all
      represent different sets of trade-offs.  The Subversion project
      itself doesn't endorse one server or another, or consider either
      server more <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">official</span>”</span> than another.</p>
      <p>Here are some reasons why you might choose one deployment
      over another, as well as reasons you
      might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> choose one.</p>

        </div>
        <p>In general, the authors of this book recommend a vanilla
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> installation for small teams just
        trying to get started with a Subversion server; it's the
        simplest to set up and has the fewest maintenance issues.
        You can always switch to a more complex server
        deployment as your needs change.</p>
        <p>Here are some general recommendations and tips, based on
        years of supporting users:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>If you're trying to set up the simplest possible server
            for your group, a vanilla <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
            installation is the easiest, fastest route.  Note,
            however, that your repository data will be transmitted in
            the clear over the network.  If your deployment is
            entirely within your company's LAN or VPN, this isn't an
            issue.  If the repository is exposed to the wide-open
            Internet, you might want to make sure that either the
            repository's contents aren't sensitive (e.g., it contains
            only open source code), or that you go the extra mile in
            configuring SASL to encrypt network communications.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>If you need to integrate with existing legacy identity
            systems (LDAP, Active Directory, NTLM, X.509, etc.),
            you must use either the Apache-based server
            or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> configured with SASL.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>If you've decided to use either Apache or stock
            <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, create a single
            <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> user on your system and run the
            server process as that user.  Be sure to make the
            repository directory wholly owned by the
            <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> user as well.  From a security
            point of view, this keeps the repository data nicely
            siloed and protected by operating system filesystem
            permissions, changeable by only the Subversion server
            process itself.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>If you have an existing infrastructure that is heavily based
            on SSH accounts, and if your users already have system
            accounts on your server machine, it makes sense to
            deploy an <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>-over-SSH solution.
            Otherwise, we don't widely recommend this option to the
            public.  It's generally considered safer to have your
            users access the repository via (imaginary) accounts
            managed by <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> or Apache, rather
            than by full-blown system accounts.  If your deep desire
            for encrypted communication still draws you to this
            option, we recommend using Apache with SSL or
            <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with SASL encryption
            instead.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be seduced by the simple
            idea of having all of your users access a repository
            directly via <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs.  Even if the
            repository is readily available to everyone via a network
            share, this is a bad idea.  It removes any layers of
            protection between the users and the repository: users can
            accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt the repository
            database, it becomes hard to take the repository offline
            for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a mess of
            file permission problems (see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.multimethod.html" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called “Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods”</a>).  Note that this
            is also one of the reasons we warn against accessing
            repositories via <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>
            URLs—from a security standpoint, it's effectively
            the same as local users accessing via
            <code class="literal">file://</code>, and it can entail all the same
            problems if the administrator isn't careful.</p>
