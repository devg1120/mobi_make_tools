      <p>Sometimes there's a single right way to do things; sometimes
      there are many.  Subversion's developers understand that while
      the majority of its exact behaviors are acceptable to most of
      its users, there are some corners of its functionality where
      such a universally pleasing approach doesn't exist.  In those
      places, Subversion offers users the opportunity to tell it how
      <span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> want it to behave.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, we explored Subversion's runtime
      configuration system and other mechanisms by which users can
      control those configurable behaviors.  If you are a developer,
      though, the next chapter will take you one step further.  It
      describes how you can further customize your Subversion
      experience by writing your own software against Subversion's
      libraries.</p>
