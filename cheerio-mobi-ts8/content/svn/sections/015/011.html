      <p>Perhaps the most important way to familiarize CVS users with
      Subversion is to let them continue to work on their projects
      using the new system.  And while that can be somewhat
      accomplished using a flat import into a Subversion repository of
      an exported CVS repository, the more thorough solution involves
      transferring not just the latest snapshot of their data, but all
      the history behind it as well, from one system to another.  This
      is an extremely difficult problem to solve; it involves
      deducing changesets in the absence of atomicity and translating
      between the systems&apos; completely orthogonal branching policies,
      among other complications.  Still, a handful of tools claim
      to at least partially support the ability to convert
      existing CVS repositories into Subversion ones.</p>
      <p>The most popular (and mature) conversion tool is
      cvs2svn (<a class="ulink" href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/</a>), a Python
      program originally created by members of Subversion&apos;s own
      development community.  This tool is meant to run exactly once:
      it scans your CVS repository multiple times and attempts to
      deduce commits, branches, and tags as best it can.  When it
      finishes, the result is either a Subversion repository or a
      portable Subversion dump file representing your code&apos;s history.
      See the web site for detailed instructions and caveats.</p>
