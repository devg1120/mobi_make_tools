      <p>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line-based.  That command-line tool
      (<span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>), and some additional auxiliary
      programs, are the focus of this book.</p>
      <p>For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader
      is using a Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable
      with Unix and command-line interfaces.  That said, the
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program also runs on non-Unix platforms
      such as Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor exceptions, such as
      the use of backward slashes (<code class="literal">\</code>) instead of
      forward slashes (<code class="literal">/</code>) for path separators, the
      input to and output from this tool when run on Windows are
      identical to that of its Unix counterpart.</p>
      <p>Most readers are probably programmers or system
      administrators who need to track changes to source code.  This
      is the most common use for Subversion, and therefore it is the
      scenario underlying all of the book&apos;s examples.  But Subversion
      can be used to manage changes to any sort of
      information&#x2014;images, music, databases, documentation, and
      so on.  To Subversion, all data is just data.</p>
      <p>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used a version control system, we&apos;ve also tried
      to make it easy for users of CVS (and other systems) to make a
      painless leap into Subversion.  Special sidebars may mention
      other version control systems from time to time, and
       summarizes many of the differences
      between CVS and Subversion.</p>
      <p>Note also that the source code examples used throughout the
      book are only examples.  While they will compile with the proper
      compiler incantations, they are intended to illustrate a
      particular scenario and not necessarily to serve as examples of good
      programming style or practices.</p>
