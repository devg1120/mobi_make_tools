<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2941824">Run-Control Files</a></h2></div></div><p>A run-control file is a file of declarations or commands
associated with a program that it interprets on startup. If a program
has site-specific configuration shared by all users at a site, it will
often have a run-control file under the <tt>/etc</tt>
directory. (Some Unixes have an <tt>/etc/conf</tt>
subdirectory that collects such data.)  </p><p>User-specific configuration information is often carried in a
hidden run-control file in the user&apos;s home directory. Such files are
often called &#x2018;dotfiles&#x2019; because they exploit the Unix
convention that a filename beginning with a dot is normally invisible
to directory-listing tools.<sup>[<a id="id2941866" href="ch10s03.html#ftn.id2941866">100</a>]</sup></p><p>Programs can also have run-control or dot directories. These
group together several configuration files that are related to the
program, but that are most conveniently treated separately (perhaps
because they relate to different subsystems of the program, or have
differing syntaxes).</p><p>Whether file or directory, convention now dictates that the
location of the run-control information has the same basename as the
executable that reads it. An older convention still common among
system programs uses the executable&apos;s name with the suffix
&#x2018;rc&#x2019; for &#x2018;run control&#x2019;.<sup>[<a id="id2941902" href="ch10s03.html#ftn.id2941902">101</a>]</sup> Thus, if you write a
program called &#x2018;seekstuff&#x2019; that has both site-wide and
user-specific configuration, an experienced Unix user would expect to
find the former at <tt>/etc/seekstuff</tt> and the latter
at <tt>.seekstuff</tt> in the user&apos;s home directory; but
it would be unsurprising if the locations were
<tt>/etc/seekstuffrc</tt> and
<tt>.seekstuffrc</tt>, especially if seekstuff were a
system utility of some sort.</p><p>In <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;5.&#xFFFD;Textuality">Chapter&#xFFFD;5</a> we
described a somewhat different set of design rules for textual data-file 
formats, and discussed how to optimize for different weightings
of interoperability,
transparency</p><p>While the semantics of run-control files are of course
completely program dependent, there are some design rules about
run-control syntax that are widely observed. We&apos;ll describe
those next; but first we&apos;ll describe an important exception.</p><p>If the program is an interpreter for a language, then it is
expected to be simply a file of commands in the syntax of that
language, to be executed at startup. This is an important rule,
because Unix tradition strongly encourages the design of all kinds of
programs as special-purpose languages and minilanguages. Well-known
examples with dotfiles of this kind include the various Unix command
shells and the <i>Emacs</i> programmable editor.</p><p>(One reason for this design rule is the belief that special
cases are bad news &#x2014; thus, that any switch that changes the
behavior of a language should be settable from within the language.
If as a language designer you find that you
<span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> express all the startup settings of a
language in the the language itself, a Unix programmer would say you
have a design problem &#x2014; which is what you should be fixing,
rather than devising a special-case run-control syntax.)</p><p>This exception aside, here are the normal style rules for 
run-control syntaxes. Historically, they are patterned on the syntax of
Unix shells:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Support explanatory comments, and lead them with
<tt>#</tt>.</em></span> The syntax should also ignore whitespace before <tt>#</tt>, so
that comments on the same line as configuration directives are
supported.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don&apos;t make insidious whitespace
distinctions.</em></span> That is, treat runs of spaces and tabs,
syntactically the same as a single space.  If your directive format is
line-oriented, it is good form to ignore trailing spaces and tabs on
lines.  The metarule is that the interpretation of the file should
not depend on distinctions a human eye can&apos;t
see.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Treat multiple blank lines and comment lines
as a single blank line</em></span>.  If the input format uses blank
lines as separators between records, you probably want to ensure that
a comment line does not end a record.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lexically treat the file as a simple
sequence of whitespace-separated tokens, or lines of tokens.</em></span>
Complicated lexical rules are hard to learn, hard to remember, and
hard for humans to parse.  Avoid them.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>But, support a string syntax for tokens with
embedded whitespace.</em></span> Use single quote or double quote as
balanced delimiters. If you support both, beware of giving them different
semantics as they have in shell; this is a well-known source
of confusion.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Support a backslash syntax for embedding
unprintable and special characters in strings</em></span>. The standard
pattern for this is the backslash-escape syntax supported by C
compilers.  Thus, for example, it would be quite surprising if the
string <tt>&quot;a\tb&quot;</tt> were not interpreted as a character
&#x2018;a&#x2019;, followed by a tab, followed by the character
&#x2018;b&#x2019;.</p></li></ol></div><p>Some aspects of shell syntax, on the other hand, should
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be emulated in run-control syntaxes &#x2014;
at least not without a good and specific reason. The shell&apos;s baroque
quoting and bracketing rules, and its special metacharacters for
wildcards and variable substitution, both fall into this
category.</p><p>It bears repeating that the point of these conventions is to
reduce the amount of novelty that users have to cope with when they
read and edit the run-control file for a program they have never seen
before. Therefore, if you have to break the conventions, try to do so
in a way that makes it visually obvious that you have done so,
document your syntax with particular care, and (most importantly)
design it so it&apos;s easy to pick up by example.</p><p>These standard style rules only describe conventions about
tokenizing and comments. The names of run-control files, their
higher-level syntax, and the semantic interpretation of the syntax are
usually application-specific. There are a very few exceptions to
this rule, however; one is dotfiles which have become
&#x2018;well-known&#x2019; in the sense that they routinely carry
information used by a whole class of applications. Sharing
run-control file formats in this way reduces the amount of novelty
users have to cope with.</p><p>Of these, probably the best established is the
<tt>.netrc</tt> file.  Internet client programs that must
track host/password pairs for a user can usually get them from
the <tt>.netrc</tt> file, if it exists.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2942210">Case Study: The <tt>.netrc</tt> File</a></h3></div></div><p>The <tt>.netrc</tt> file is a good example of the
standard rules in action.  An example, with the passwords changed to
protect the innocent, is in <a href="ch10s03.html#netrc" title="Example&#xFFFD;10.1.&#xFFFD;A .netrc example.">Example&#xFFFD;10.1</a>.</p><div class="example"><a id="netrc"><p class="title"><b>Example&#xFFFD;10.1.&#xFFFD;A <tt>.netrc</tt> example.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">

used on almost any operating system, but dotfiles are rather more
difficult to map to a non-Unix environment. The critical thing
missing from most non-Unix operating systems is true multiuser
capability and the notion of a per-user home directory. DOS and
Windows versions up to ME (including 95 and 98), for example,
completely lack any such notion; all configuration information has to
be stored either in systemwide run-control files at a fixed location,
the Windows registry, or configuration files in the same directory a
program is run from.  Windows NT has some notion of per-user home
directories (which made its way into Windows 2000 and XP), but it is
only poorly supported by the system tools.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2941866" href="ch10s03.html#id2941866">100</a>] </sup>To make dotfiles visible,
