violating them will increase friction costs for users and
developers in the future. Break them if you must &#x2014; but be sure you
know exactly why you are doing so before you do it. And if you do
break them, make sure that attempts to do things in conventional ways
break noisily, giving proper error feedback in accordance with the
Rule of Repair.</p></div>
