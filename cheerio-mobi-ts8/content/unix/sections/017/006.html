open-source</p><p>Documentation is often a more serious issue. Many high-quality
open-source packages are less useful than they technically ought to be
because they are poorly documentated. Unix tradition encourages a
rather hieratic style of documentation, one which (while it may
technically capture all of a package&apos;s features) assumes that the
reader is intimately familiar with the application domain and reading
very carefully. There are good reasons for this, which we&apos;ll discuss
in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;18.&#xFFFD;Documentation">Chapter&#xFFFD;18</a>, but the
style can present a bit of a barrier.  Fortunately, extracting value
from it is a learnable skill.</p><p>It is worth doing a Web search for phrases including the 
software package, or topic keywords, and the string &#x201C;HOWTO&#x201D; or
&#x201C;FAQ&#x201D;. These queries will often turn up documentation
more useful to novices than the man page.</p><p>The most serious issue in reusing open-source software
(especially in any kind of commercial product) is understanding what
obligations, if any, the package&apos;s license puts upon you. In the next
two sections we&apos;ll discuss this issue in detail.</p></div>
