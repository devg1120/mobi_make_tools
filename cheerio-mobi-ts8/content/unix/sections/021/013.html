eating the morning meal with his students.</p><p>&#x201C;I hear y00 are very l33t&#x201D;, he said.
&#x201C;Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know&#x201D;.</p><p>Master Foo&apos;s students looked at each other, confused by the
stranger&apos;s barbarous language. Master Foo just smiled and replied:
&#x201C;You wish to learn the Way of Unix?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I want to b3 a wizard hax0r&#x201D;, the stranger
replied, &#x201C;and 0wn ever3one&apos;s b0xen&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not teach that Way&#x201D;, replied Master Foo.</p><p>The stranger grew agitated.  &#x201C;D00d, y00 r nothing but a
p0ser&#x201D;, he said.  &#x201C;If y00 n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch
m3&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;There is a path&#x201D;, said Master Foo, &#x201C;that
might bring you to wisdom&#x201D;.  The master scribbled an IP address on
a piece of paper.  &#x201C;Cracking this box should pose you little
difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent.  Return and tell me 
what you find&#x201D;.</p><p>The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.</p><p>Days passed, then months.  The stranger was forgotten.</p><p>Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn you!&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;I cracked that box, and
it was easy like you said.  But I got busted by the FBI and thrown
in jail&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;Good&#x201D;, said Master Foo.  &#x201C;You are ready for
the next lesson&#x201D;.  He scribbled an IP address on another piece
of paper and handed it to the stranger.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you <span class="emphasis"><em>crazy</em></span>?&#x201D; the stranger
yelled. &#x201C;After what I&apos;ve been through, I&apos;m never going to break
into a computer again!&#x201D;</p><p>Master Foo smiled.  &#x201C;Here&#x201D;, he said, &#x201C;is the
beginning of wisdom&#x201D;.</p><p>On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.</p></div>
