end user, having heard tales of the Master&apos;s wisdom, came to him for
guidance.</p><p>He bowed three times to Master Foo. &#x201C;I wish to learn the
Great Way of Unix&#x201D;, he said &#x201C;but the command line
confuses me&#x201D;.</p><p>Some of the onlooking neophytes began to mock the end user,
calling him &#x201C;clueless&#x201D; and saying that the Way of
Unix is only for those of discipline and intelligence.</p><p>The Master held up a hand for silence, and called the most
obstreperous of the neophytes who had mocked forward, to where
he and the end user sat.</p><p>&#x201C;Tell me&#x201D;, he asked the neophyte, &#x201C;of the
code you have written and the works of design you have
uttered&#x201D;.</p><p>The neophyte began to stammer out a reply, but fell silent.</p><p>Master Foo turned to the end-user. &#x201C;Tell me&#x201D;, he
inquired, &#x201C;why do you seek the Way?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am discontent with the software I see around
me&#x201D;, the end user replied. &#x201C;It neither performs reliably
nor pleases the eye and hand.  Having heard that the Unix way, though
difficult, is superior, I seek to cast aside all snares and
delusions&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;And what do you do in the world&#x201D;, asked Master Foo,
&#x201C;that you must strive with software?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am a builder&#x201D;, the end user replied, &#x201C;Many
of the houses of this town were made under my chop&#x201D;.</p><p>Master Foo turned back to the neophyte.  &#x201C;The housecat may
mock the tiger&#x201D;, said the master, &#x201C;but doing so will not
make his purr into a roar&#x201D;.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the neophyte was enlightened.</p></div>
