</span></i></span></div><p>We concluded <a href="historychapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;2.&#xFFFD;History">Chapter&#xFFFD;2</a> by observing the largest-scale pattern in
Unix&apos;s history; it flourished when its practices most closely
approximated open source, and stagnated when they did not.  We then
asserted in <a href="reusechapter.html" title="Chapter&#xFFFD;16.&#xFFFD;Reuse">Chapter&#xFFFD;16</a> that
open-source development tools tend to be of high quality.  We&apos;ll begin
this chapter by sketching an explanation of how and why open-source
development works.  Most of its behaviors are simply intensifications
of long-established Unix-tradition practices.</p><p>We&apos;ll then descend from realm of abstraction and describe some
of the most important folk customs that Unix has picked up from the
open-source community &#x2014; in particular, the community-evolved
guidelines for what a good source-code release looks like.  Many of
these customs could be profitably adopted by developers on other modern
operating systems as well.</p><p>We&apos;ll describe these customs on the assumption that you are
developing open source; most are still good ideas even if you are
writing proprietary software.  The open-source assumption is also
historically appropriate, because many of these customs found their
way back into proprietary Unix shops via ubiquitous open-source tools
like
patch(1),
<i>Emacs</i>, and GCC</p></div>
