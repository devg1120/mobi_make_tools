      </div>
      <p>You've seen how a repository can be accessed in many
      different ways.  But is it possible—or safe—for your
      repository to be accessed by multiple methods simultaneously?
      The answer is yes, provided you use a bit of foresight.</p>
      <p>At any given time, these processes may require read and
      write access to your repository:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Regular system users using a Subversion client (as
          themselves) to access the repository directly via
          <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Regular system users connecting to SSH-spawned private
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> processes (running as
          themselves), which access the repository</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>An <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process—either a
          daemon or one launched by
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span>—running as a particular fixed
          user</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>An Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> process, running as a
          particular fixed user</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>The most common problem administrators run into is
      repository ownership and permissions.  Does every process (or
      user) in the preceding list have the rights to read and write the
      repository's underlying data files?  Assuming you have a
      Unix-like operating system, a straightforward approach might be
      to place every potential repository user into a
      new <code class="literal">svn</code> group, and make the repository wholly
      owned by that group.  But even that's not enough, because a
      process may write to the database files using an unfriendly
      umask—one that prevents access by other users.</p>
      <p>So the next step beyond setting up a common group for
      repository users is to force every repository-accessing process
      to use a sane umask.  For users accessing the repository
      directly, you can make the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program into a
      wrapper script that first runs <strong class="userinput"><code>umask 002</code></strong> and
      then runs the real <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> client program.  You
      can write a similar wrapper script for the
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program, and add a <strong class="userinput"><code>umask
      002</code></strong> command to Apache's own startup script,
      <code class="filename">apachectl</code>.  For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ cat /usr/bin/svn

#!/bin/sh

umask 002
/usr/bin/svn-real "$@"
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Another common problem is often encountered on Unix-like
      systems.  If your repository is backed by Berkeley DB, for
      example, it occasionally creates new log files to journal its
      actions.  Even if the Berkeley DB repository is wholly owned by
      the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> group, these newly created log files
      won't necessarily be owned by that same group, which then
      creates more permissions problems for your users.  A good
      workaround is to set the group SUID bit on the
      repository's <code class="filename">db</code> directory.  This causes all
      newly created log files to have the same group owner as the
      parent directory.</p>
      <p>Once you've jumped through these hoops, your repository
      should be accessible by all the necessary processes.  It may
      seem a bit messy and complicated, but the problems of having
      multiple users sharing write access to common files are classic
      ones that are not often elegantly solved.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, most repository administrators will never
      <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to have such a complex configuration.
      Users who wish to access repositories that live on the same
      machine are not limited to using <code class="literal">file://</code>
      access URLs—they can typically contact the Apache HTTP
      server or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> using
      <code class="literal">localhost</code> for the server name in their
      <code class="literal">http://</code> or <code class="literal">svn://</code> URL.
      And maintaining multiple server processes for your Subversion
      repositories is likely to be more of a headache than necessary.
      We recommend that you choose a single server that best meets your
      needs and stick with it!</p>

        <p>It can be quite tricky to get a bunch of users with
        existing SSH accounts to share a repository without
        permissions problems.  If you're confused about all the things
        that you (as an administrator) need to do on a Unix-like
        system, here's a quick checklist that resummarizes some of the
        topics discussed in this section:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>All of your SSH users need to be able to read and
            write to the repository, so put all the SSH users into a
            single group.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Make the repository wholly owned by that group.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Set the group permissions to read/write.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Your users need to use a sane umask when accessing the
            repository, so make sure <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
            (<code class="filename">/usr/bin/svnserve</code>, or wherever it
            lives in <code class="literal">$PATH</code>) is actually a wrapper
            script that runs <strong class="userinput"><code>umask 002</code></strong> and
            executes the real <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
            binary.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Take similar measures when using
            <span class="command"><strong>svnlook</strong></span> and
            <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span>.  Either run them with a sane
            umask or wrap them as just described.</p>
