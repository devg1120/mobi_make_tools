<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">modular programming</a>, developers break programs up into discrete chunks of functionality called a <em>module</em>.</p>
<p>Each module has a smaller surface area than a full program, making verification, debugging, and testing trivial.
    Well-written <em>modules</em> provide solid abstractions and encapsulation boundaries, so that each module has a coherent design and a clear purpose within the overall application.</p>
<p>Node.js has supported modular programming almost since its inception.
    On the web, however, support for <em>modules</em> has been slow to arrive.
    Multiple tools exist that support modular JavaScript on the web, with a variety of benefits and limitations.
    webpack builds on lessons learned from these systems and applies the concept of <em>modules</em> to any file in your project.</p>
