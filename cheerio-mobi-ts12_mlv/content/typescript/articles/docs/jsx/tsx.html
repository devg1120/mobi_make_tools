<h1 id="jsx-support">JSX Support</h1>
<p>TypeScript supports JSX transpilation and code analysis. If you are unfamiliar with JSX here is an excerpt from the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/" target="_blank">official website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics. It's NOT intended to be implemented by engines or browsers. It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the ECMAScript spec itself. It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The motivation behind JSX is to allow users to write HTML like views <em>in JavaScript</em> so that you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have the view Type Checked by the same code that is going to check your JavaScript</li>
    <li>Have the view be aware of the context it is going to operate under (i.e. strengthen the <em>controller-view</em> connection in traditional MVC).</li>
    <li>Reuse JavaScript patterns for HTML maintenance e.g. <code>Array.prototype.map</code>, <code>?:</code>, <code>switch</code> etc instead of creating new (and probably poorly typed) alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>This decreases the chances of errors and increases the maintainability of your user interfaces. The main consumer of JSX at this point is <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">ReactJS from facebook</a>. This is the usage of JSX that we will discuss here.</p>
